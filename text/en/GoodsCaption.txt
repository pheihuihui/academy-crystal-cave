190	A shard of the shattered Elden Ring.\nGrants the blessing of an equipped Great Rune upon use.\n\nEven if no Great Rune is equipped, it will slightly increase maximum HP upon use.\n\nThe lower arc of the Elden Ring is held to be the basin in which its blessings pool. Perhaps this shard originates from that very arc.
191	A Great Rune of the shardbearer Godrick.\nIts blessing raises all attributes.\n\nThis Great Rune is known as the anchor ring, found in the center of the Elden Ring.\n\nThe first demigods were The Elden Lord Godfrey and his offspring, the golden lineage.

196	A Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia.\nThe blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears.\n\nAnd yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance, attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP.\n\nMalenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.

1000	The Tarnished will soon return.
1001	Guided by Grace once lost.
1002	The Golden Order is broken to its core.
1003	They will fight. And they will die. In an unending curse.
1004	For how else is a champion, or a lord, to be born?
1005	Brandish the Elden Ring.
1006	...for all of us.
1100	The fallen leaves have spoken.
1101	Of the return of the Tarnished. To the Lands Between.
10000000	Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring.
10000100	Shaper of life, arbiter of fate.
10000200	Lord of the very stars above.
10000300	Tarnished warrior, spurned by the grace of gold.
10000400	Seek that which hath been lost to thee.
10000500	Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
10000600	Seek the Elden Ring!
11000000	Brave Tarnished. Mighty warriors, who fought at my side.
11000100	Await the summons. It will call to thee one day.
11000200	Heed the fading grace. Listen to the Fingers.
11000300	Gold commandeth the very stars,
11000400	giving life its fullest brilliance.
11000500	Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring.
11000600	Be ready, once it is shattered.
11000700	Seek the Elden Ring, O Tarnished.
11000800	Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
11000900	Become Lord. Enact thy will!
11001000	Seek the Elden Ring!
12000000	Long ago, ye Tarnished lost something most dear.
12000100	The Elden Ring. O Elden Ring.
12000200	Its gold commanded the very stars,
12000300	giving life its fullest brilliance.
12000400	Though shattered, it yet guides thy kin.
12000401	
12000402	
12000403	
12000404	
12000405	
12000406	
12000407	
12000408	
12000409	
12000410	Though fractured, it yet guides thy kin.
12000500	Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
12000600	Hoarah Roux, the Gold Mask.
12000700	Lady Yuliya, the Deathbed Companion.
12000800	The hideous Dung Eater.
12000900	And Sir Gideon Orphnier, the All-knowing.
12001000	Each coveteth the Elden Ring.
12001100	But their ambitions are yet unmet.
12001200	Surely thou hast thine own design?
12001300	Then implore the Two Fingers, for guidance.
12001400	Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
12001500	To face the Elden Ring.
12001501	
12001502	
12001503	
12001504	
12001505	
12001506	
12001507	
12001508	
12001509	
12001510	To stand before the Elden Ring.
12001600	Face the Elden Ring.
12001601	
12001602	
12001603	
12001604	
12001605	
12001606	
12001607	
12001608	
12001609	
12001610	And reclaim what was thine.
13000000	Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.
13000100	Its gold commanded the very stars,
13000200	giving life its fullest brilliance.
13000300	Shattered, by someone, or something.
13000301	
13000302	
13000303	
13000304	
13000305	
13000306	
13000307	
13000308	
13000309	
13000310	Fractured, by someone, or something.
13000400	Godrick, the feeble.
13000500	Malenia, decayed from birth.
13000600	General Radahn, slayer of giants.
13000700	Rykard, the tyrannical serpent.
13000800	And Morgott, Prince of the Omen.
13000900	Each, inheriting their own shard, played a part in the Shattering,
13001000	a war with no end, and no victor.
13001100	And so the Two Fingers call upon ye, the Tarnished.
13001200	To cross the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
13001300	To seek the Elden Ring.
13001400	Seek the Elden Ring.
14000000	The fallen leaves tell a story.
14000100	The great Elden Ring was shattered.
14000200	In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
14000300	Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,
14000400	and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish.
14000500	Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.
14000600	The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.
14000800	A war from which no lord arose.
14000900	A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.
15000000	Arise now, ye Tarnished.
15000100	Ye dead, who yet live.
15000200	The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.
15000300	Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands.
15000400	The ever-brilliant Goldmask.
15000500	Fia, the Deathbed Companion.
15000600	The loathsome Dung Eater.
15000700	And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.
15000800	
16000000	It happened an age ago.
16000100	But when I recall, I see it true.
16000200	On a night of wint'ry fog.
16000300	The Rune of Death was stolen,
16000400	And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.
16000500	Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
16000600	The Elden Ring was broken,
16000700	triggering the Shattering, an internecine war between demigods.
16000800	The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.
16000900	And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.
16001000	These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.
16001100	But there would be no victor.
16001200	And so, we inhabit a fractured world.
16001300	Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.
16001400	Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?
16500000	It happened an age ago.
16500100	But when I recall, I see it true.
16500200	On a night of wint'ry fog.
16500300	Bearers of Black Knives stole into the dark.
16500400	And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.
16500500	Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
16500600	The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.
16500700	The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?
16500800	What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?
16500900	The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.
16501000	And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.
16501100	These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.
16501200	But why was there no victor?
16501300	And so, we inhabit a fractured world.
16501400	Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.
16501500	Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?
20010000	You think this is the one, Torrent?
20010001	
20010002	
20010003	
20010004	
20010005	
20010006	
20010007	
20010008	
20010009	
20010010	Is that him, Torrent?
20010011	Is that her, Torrent?
20010100	Don't worry, it's not too late.
20010200	He is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
20010201	She is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
20010300	...For that is their curse.
20015000	Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his side.
20015001	Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on her side.
20015100	We found him here, after all.
20015101	We found her here, after all.
20015200	One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
20015201	One of her kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
20015300	...Even if it does violate the Golden Order...
20019000	
20030000	Foul Tarnished,
20030100	In search of the Elden Ring.
20030200	Emboldened by the flame of ambition.
20030300	Hrah!
20030400	Someone must extinguish thy flame.
20030500	Let it be Margit the Fell!
20039000	
20040000	Mighty dragon, thou'rt a trueborn heir.
20040100	Lend me thy strength, o kindred.
20040200	Deliver me unto greater heights.
20040300	...Well.
20040400	A lowly Tarnished,
20040401	
20040402	
20040403	
20040404	
20040405	
20040406	
20040407	
20040408	
20040409	
20040410	playing as a lord.
20040500	I command thee, kneel!
20040600	I am the lord of all that is golden!
20049000

20050010	 
20050100	 <panting>
20050200	Ahh, truest of dragons.
20050300	Lend me thy strength...
20050400	Nnngh! 
20050500	<panting>
20050600	Forefathers, one and all...
20050700	Great King Godfrey...
20050800	Bear witness!
20059000	
20070000	It's been a long while, Morgott.
20070100	Long and hard didst thou fight.
20070200	Tarnished Warrior.

20070206	
20070207	
20070208	
20070209	
20070210	Spurned by the grace of gold.
20070300	Be assured, the Elden Ring
20070400	resteth close at hand.
20070500	Alas, I am returned.
20070600	To be granted audience once more.
20070700	Upon my name as Godfrey,
20070800	The first Elden Lord!
20079000	
20080000	Nngh!
20080100	That will be all.
20080200	Thou didst me good service, Serosh.
20080300	I've given thee courtesy enough.
20080500	Rrraaargh!
20080600	<exhales>
20080700	Now I fight as Hoarah Loux!
20080800	Warrior!
20089000	
20099000	
20109000	
20129000	
20140000	Dearest Miquella.
20140100	You must abide alone a while.
20140200	No one else will take you.
20140300	Never again, I swear!
20145200	Welcome, honoured guest.
20145300	To the birthplace of our dynasty!
20149000	
20169000	
20209000	
20210000	Foul Tarnished.
20210100	Graceless Tarnished.
20210200	What is thy business with these thrones?
20210300	Ahh...
20210400	Godrick the Golden.
20210500	The twin prodigies, Miquella and Malenia.
20210600	General Radahn.
20210700	Praetor Rykard.
20210800	Lunar Princess Ranni.
20210900	Wilful traitors, all.
20211000	Thy kind are all of a piece.
20211100	Pillagers, come seeking vengeance upon the Erdtree.
20211101	
20211102

20211109	
20211110	Pillagers. Emboldened by the flame of ambition.
20211200	Ngh!
20211300	Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:
20211400	Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings.
20219000	
20230000	 
20230100	O, Death.

20230200	Become my blade, once more.
20230300	 
20230400	 
20230500	<long exhalation>
20239000	
20240100	Ahh, art thou come to be born anew?
20240200	Be not afraid, there is no pain...
20240300	<children giggling>
20245100	Hush, little culver.
20245101	Hush, fair maid.
20245200	I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...
20249000	
20250000	Ahh, my beloved...
20250100	Have no fear, I will hold thee. Patience...

20250210	Ye will be countless, born, forever.
20250300	Defiler of mother's rich slumber.
20250400	Upon my name as Ranni the\nWitch, thou wilt not go\nunpunished.
20250500	After death, quite the tale will be\nthine to tell.
20250600	Of the last Queen of Caria,\nRennala of the Full Moon.
20250700	And the majesty of the night\nshe conjureth.
20255000	Ahh, my sweet children...

20255300	Upon my name as Ranni the Witch.
20255410	Mother's rich slumber shall not be\ndisturbed by thee.
20255500	Foul trespasser.
20255600	Send word far and wide.
20255700	Of the last Queen of Caria,\nRennala of the Full Moon.
20255800	And the majesty of the night\nshe conjureth.
20259000	
20260000	I dreamt for so long.
20260100	My flesh was dull gold...and my blood, rotted.
20260200	Corpse after corpse, left in my wake...
20260300	As I awaited...his return.
20260400	...Heed my words.
20260500	I am Malenia.\nBlade of Miquella.
20260600	And I have never known defeat.
20265000	Sweet Tarnished...
20265001	
20265002	
20265003	
20265004	
20265005	
20265006	
20265007	
20265008	
20265009	
20265010	Dearest companion...
20265100	Did you not heed my warning?
20265200	Your greed knows no end.
20265300	You would steal the last drop of warmth from his empty frame?
20265301	
20265302	
20265303	
20265304	
20265305	
20265306	
20265307	
20265308	
20265309	
20265310	After all you've taken, you still want more?
20265400	Then you will have to kill me.
20265500	I am Malenia, Sword of Miquella.
20265600	And I have never known defeat.
20269000	
20270000	My dear twin, accept this gift.
20270100	A gift of abundance, my last drop of dew.
20270200	Let all things flourish,
20270300	whether graceful, or malign.
20275000	Wait.
20275100	The scarlet bloom flowers once more.
20275200	You will witness true horror.
20275300	Now, rot!
20279000	
20289000	
20290000	Farewell, then.
20290100	May your visit be fruitful.
20299000	
20300000	Hmm...
20300100	Very well.
20300200	You...
20300300	A fitting sacrifice you shall be, for the Serpent King.
20300301	
20300302	
20300303	
20300304	
20300305	
20300306	
20300307	
20300308	
20300309	
20300310	Join the Serpent King, as family...
20300400	And devour the gods with me!
20300401	
20300402	
20300403	
20300404	
20300405	
20300406	
20300407	
20300408	
20300409	
20300410	Together, we will devour the very gods!
20309000

20389200	
20390000	 
20390100	 
20390200	 
20390300	 
20390400	 
20391000	General Radahn is cursed ever to wander.
20391001	
20391002	
20391003	
20391004	
20391005	
20391006	
20391007	
20391008	
20391009	
20391010	Before we begin, allow me to paint you the full picture.
20391100	Eaten from the inside, by Malenia's scarlet rot, his wits are long gone.
20391200	Now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them, like a dog.
20391300	Howling at the sky.
20409000	
20430000	O Erdtree, you shall burn.
20430100	Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.
20430200	Thank you. For guiding me here.
20430300	The one who walks alongside flame,
20430400	Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.
20430500	Good-bye.
20430600	I hope you will become Lord. Lord of each and all.
20439000	
20439200	
20450000	Aaargh! Aargh!
20450100	<guttural moan>
20450200	Nngghaa!
20450300	Argh!
20450400	<great howl>
20459000	
20479000	
20480000	Now wilt ye serve, each and all.
20480001	
20480002	
20480003	
20480004	
20480005	
20480006	
20480007	
20480008	
20480009	
20480010	The Elden Lord is crowned.
20480100	The new Elden Lord,\nsteward of a fracturing world.
20480101	
20480102	
20480103	
20480104	
20480105	
20480106	
20480107	
20480108	
20480109	
20480110	And so beginneth the age of fracture...
20481000	The fallen leaves tell a story.
20481100	Of how a Tarnished, of no renown, became Elden Lord.
20482000	The fallen leaves tell a story.
20482100	Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.
20482200	In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
20483000	Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
20483100	An Age of Fracture.
20484000	Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
20484100	The Age of Order.
20484150	The Age Absolute.
20485000	Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
20485100	The Age of the Duskborn
20486000	Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
20486100	The reviled curse that defined our age.
20486200	The Blessing of Despair.
20489000	
20490000	...The battle is over, I see.
20490100	I do solemnly swear.
20490200	To every living being, and every living soul.
20490300	Now cometh the age of the stars.
20490400	A thousand year voyage\nunder the wisdom of the Moon.
20490500	Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.
20490600	Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...
20490700	As the path stretcheth into darkness...
20490800	Well then. Shall we?
20490900	My fair consort, eternal.
20495000	...The battle is over, I see.
20495001	
20495002	
20495003	
20495004	
20495005	
20495006	
20495007	
20495008	
20495009	
20495010	...All matters are settled, then.
20495100	I do solemnly swear.
20495200	To all the hearts that remain in thy thrall.
20495201	
20495202	
20495203	
20495204	
20495205	
20495206	
20495207	
20495208	
20495209	
20495210	To all life, and the souls harboured therein.
20495300	Now comes the age of the mind.
20495400	A thousand year voyage,\ngoverned by the wisdom of the Moon.
20495500	All shall be encompassed, in a still and silent night, unending.\nAnd thought shall turn to fear,
20495600	emptiness, life...
20495700	And a path stretching into the darkness...
20495850	Let us go, together.
20495950	My dear consort, eternal.
20499000	
20500000	Lord of Frenzied Flame...
20500110	I will seek you, as far as you may travel...
20500200	To deliver you what is yours.
20500300	Destined Death.
20540000	Young seedling, young seedling.
20540100	Return to the bosom of earth.
20540200	But remember well,
20540300	Thou'rt mine.
20540400	So shall I give of myself. This is for thee.
20540500	Mine abundance, my drop of dew.
20540600	Quench thy thirst, throughout thy frame.
20540700	Blossom and burgeon, time and again.
20540800	Grow larger, stronger.
20540900	Until the day cometh.
20541000	When thou canst share in my dream.
20541100	Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.
20541200	Beget Order most elegant, from my tender reverie.
20559000	
20560000	If thou covetest the throne,
20560100	Impress my vision upon thine heart.
20560200	In the new world of thy making,
20560300	all things will flourish,
20560400	whether graceful, or malign.
20569000	
20580000	Greetings.
20580100	Traveller from beyond the Fog.
20580200	I am Melina.
20580300	I offer you an accord.
20589000	
20589100	
20589200	
20589300	
20589400	
20589500	
20599000	
20629000	
20639000	
20640000	And one other. Whom grace would again bless.
20640100	A Tarnished of no renown.
20640200	Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.
20640300	To stand before the Elden Ring.
20640400	And become the Elden Lord.
20649000	
20689000	
20699000	
20700000	The Rune of Death is unbound.
20700100	Black flames have devoured the Erdtree,
20700101	
20700102	
20700103	
20700104	
20700105	
20700106	
20700107	
20700108	
20700109	
20700110	and the Lands Between are shrouded by Death's dark fate.
20700200	But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.
20700300	Farewell it is, then.
20700400	You'll be Elden Lord, yet.
20730000	Well, if you really are that gullible...
20730001	
20730002	
20730003	
20730004	
20730005	
20730006	
20730007	
20730008	
20730009	
20730010	Ngh!
20730100	then stay away from the Volcano Manor!
20730200	Bye now!
20730300	Take care!
20739000	
20740000	
20750000	
20750100	Lord host, I could not be more content.
20750200	I found knowledge, and then found someone. That someone was you.
20750300	And now, inside you, here I am...
20760000	
20770000	Well well well?
20770100	I should have known, you scheming little thief.
20770200	The gods demand vengeance. Vengeance!
20780000	He he he he he...
20780100	My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.
20780200	You're the finest customer a man ever had!
20830000	 
20830100	This is how you die, you disgusting Tarnished.
20830200	Don't worry, I've got big plans for you. After you snuff it...
20840000	 
20840100	 
20840200	 
20850000	<screaming>
20850100	 
20850200	 
20860000	<screaming>
20860100	 
20860200	(explained above)
20860300	Unleash it upon them! A cursed blessing to all!
20860400	(scream of pain)
100010000	Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?
100010001	
100010002	
100010003	
100010004	
100010005	
100010006	
100010007	
100010008	
100010009	
100010010	They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished.
100010011	
100010012	
100010013	
100010014	
100010015	
100010016	
100010017	
100010018	
100010019	
100010020	But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.
100010021	
100010022	
100010023	
100010024	
100010025	
100010026	
100010027	
100010028	
100010029	
100010030	I can play the role of maiden.
100010031	
100010032	
100010033	
100010034	
100010035	
100010036	
100010037	
100010038	
100010039	
100010040	Turning runes into strength.
100010041	
100010042	
100010043	
100010044	
100010045	
100010046	
100010047	
100010048	
100010049	
100010050	To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.
100010051	
100010052	
100010053	
100010054	
100010055	
100010056	
100010057	
100010058	
100010059	
100010060	You need only take me with you.
100010061	
100010062	
100010063	
100010064	
100010065	
100010066	
100010067	
100010068	
100010069	
100010070	To the foot of the Erdtree.
100011000	Then it's settled.
100011001	
100011002	
100011003	
100011004	
100011005	
100011006	
100011007	
100011008	
100011009	
100011010	Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength.
100011011	
100011012	
100011013	
100011014	
100011015	
100011016	
100011017	
100011018	
100011019	
100011020	Ahh, another matter.
100011021	
100011022	
100011023	
100011024	
100011025	
100011026	
100011027	
100011028	
100011029	
100011030	I bequeath to you this ring.
100011031	
100011032	
100011033	
100011034	
100011035	
100011036	
100011037	
100011038	
100011039	
100011040	Use it to traverse great distances.
100011041	
100011042	
100011043	
100011044	
100011045	
100011046	
100011047	
100011048	
100011049	
100011050	It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent.
100011051	
100011052	
100011053	
100011054	
100011055	
100011056	
100011057	
100011058	
100011059	
100011060	Torrent has chosen you.
100011061	
100011062	
100011063	
100011064	
100011065	
100011066	
100011067	
100011068	
100011069	
100011070	Treat him with respect.
100012000	I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger.
100012001	
100012002	
100012003	
100012004	
100012005	
100012006	
100012007	
100012008	
100012009	
100012010	Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.
100012011	
100012012	
100012013	
100012014	
100012015	
100012016	
100012017	
100012018	
100012019	
100012020	Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.
100013000	Have you reconsidered my offer?
100020000	Shall I turn your runes to strength?
100020001	
100020002	
100020003	
100020004	
100020005	
100020006	
100020007	
100020008	
100020009	
100020010	Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
100021000	 
100022000	Phew. It is done.
100030000	This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree.
100030001	
100030002	
100030003	
100030004	
100030005	
100030006	
100030007	
100030008	
100030009	
100030010	This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.
100030011	
100030012	
100030013	
100030014	
100030015	
100030016	
100030017	
100030018	
100030019	
100030020	But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear.
100030021	
100030022	
100030023	
100030024	
100030025	
100030026	
100030027	
100030028	
100030029	
100030030	You can see them, can't you?
100030031	
100030032	
100030033	
100030034	
100030035	
100030036	
100030037	
100030038	
100030039	
100030040	The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.
100031000	Me?
100031001	
100031002	
100031003	
100031004	
100031005	
100031006	
100031007	
100031008	
100031009	
100031010	I'm searching.
100031011	
100031012	
100031013	
100031014	
100031015	
100031016	
100031017	
100031018	
100031019	
100031020	For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago.
100031021	
100031022	
100031023	
100031024	
100031025	
100031026	
100031027	
100031028	
100031029	
100031030	For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless.
100031031	
100031032	
100031033	
100031034	
100031035	
100031036	
100031037	
100031038	
100031039	
100031040	There is something for which I must apologise.
100031041	
100031042	
100031043	
100031044	
100031045	
100031046	
100031047	
100031048	
100031049	
100031050	I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance.
100031051	
100031052	
100031053	
100031054	
100031055	
100031056	
100031057	
100031058	
100031059	
100031060	I am no maiden. My purpose…was long ago lost.
100032000	Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer.
100032001	
100032002	
100032003	
100032004	
100032005	
100032006	
100032007	
100032008	
100032009	
100032010	A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.
100032011	
100032012	
100032013	
100032014	
100032015	
100032016	
100032017	
100032018	
100032019	
100032020	If the rays of grace signal the castle,
100032021	
100032022	
100032023	
100032024	
100032025	
100032026	
100032027	
100032028	
100032029	
100032030	then the Elden Ring beckons you.
100032031	
100032032	
100032033	
100032034	
100032035	
100032036	
100032037	
100032038	
100032039	
100032040	As an ally by pact,
100032041	
100032042	
100032043	
100032044	
100032045	
100032046	
100032047	
100032048	
100032049	
100032050	...I pray that you are fit...
100032051	
100032052	
100032053	
100032054	
100032055	
100032056	
100032057	
100032058	
100032059	
100032060	To face the challenge presented by the Ring.
100040000	Spoken echoes linger here.
100040001	
100040002	
100040003	
100040004	
100040005	
100040006	
100040007	
100040008	
100040009	
100040010	Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago.
100040011	
100040012	
100040013	
100040014	
100040015	
100040016	
100040017	
100040018	
100040019	
100040020	If you wish, I will share them with you.
100041000	Very well. In Marika's own words.
100041001	
100041002	
100041003	
100041004	
100041005	
100041006	
100041007	
100041008	
100041009	
100041010	My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.
100041011	
100041012	
100041013	
100041014	
100041015	
100041016	
100041017	
100041018	
100041019	
100041020	With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.
100041021	
100041022	
100041023	
100041024	
100041025	
100041026	
100041027	
100041028	
100041029	
100041030	Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.
100041031

100041037	
100041038	
100041039	
100041040	Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.
100042000	Of course. Perhaps there is no need.
100042001	
100042002	
100042003	
100042004	
100042005	
100042006	
100042007	
100042008	
100042009	
100042010	Tell me if you should change your mind.
100043000	Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well.
100043001	
100043002	
100043003	
100043004	
100043005	
100043006	
100043007	
100043008	
100043009	
100043010	Shall I share them with you?
100044000	In Marika's own words.
100044001	
100044002	
100044003	
100044004	
100044005	
100044006	
100044007	
100044008	
100044009	
100044010	Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.
100044011	
100044012	
100044013	
100044014	
100044015	
100044016	
100044017	
100044018	
100044019	
100044020	Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.
100044021	
100044022	
100044023	
100044024	
100044025	
100044026	
100044027	
100044028	
100044029	
100044030	Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.
100045000	In Marika's own words.
100045001	
100045002	
100045003

100045005	
100045006	
100045007	
100045008	
100045009	
100045010	The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.
100045011

100045014	
100045015	
100045016	
100045017	
100045018	
100045019	
100045020	Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.
100045021	
100045022	
100045023	
100045024	
100045025	
100045026	
100045027	
100045028	
100045029	
100045030	To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.
100101000	In Marika's own words.
100101001	
100101002	
100101003

100101013	
100101014	
100101015	
100101016	
100101017	
100101018	
100101019	
100101020	Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God.
100101021	
100101022	
100101023	
100101024	
100101025	
100101026	
100101027	
100101028	
100101029	
100101030	But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.
100101031	
100101032	
100101033	
100101034

100101037	
100101038	
100101039	
100101040	Amounting only to sacrifices...

100102006	
100102007	
100102008	
100102009	
100102010	O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.
100102011	
100102012	
100102013	
100102014	
100102015	
100102016	
100102017	
100102018	
100102019	
100102020	Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.
100102021	
100102022	
100102023	
100102024	
100102025	
100102026	
100102027	
100102028	
100102029	
100102030	Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.
100103000	In Marika's own words.
100103001	
100103002	
100103003

100103005	
100103006	
100103007	
100103008	
100103009	
100103010	I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.
100103011

100103013	
100103014	
100103015	
100103016	
100103017	
100103018	
100103019	
100103020	Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.
100103021	
100103022	
100103023	
100103024	
100103025	
100103026	
100103027	
100103028	
100103029	
100103030	Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.

100103038	
100103039	
100103040	My comrades; why must ye falter?
100104000	In Marika's own words.
100104001	
100104002	
100104003

100104007	
100104008	
100104009	
100104010	Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.
100104011	
100104012	
100104013	
100104014	
100104015

100104017	
100104018	
100104019	
100104020	Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.
100104021

100104023	
100104024	
100104025	
100104026	
100104027	
100104028	
100104029	
100104030	Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.
100104031

100104034

100104036	
100104037	
100104038	
100104039	
100104040	Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.

100104046	
100104047	
100104048	
100104049	
100104050	Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!
100105000	Forgive me. I've been...testing you.
100105001	
100105002	
100105003	
100105004	
100105005	
100105006	
100105007	
100105008	
100105009	
100105010	To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.
100105011	
100105012	
100105013	
100105014	
100105015	
100105016	
100105017	
100105018	
100105019	
100105020	And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails.

100105023	
100105024

100105078	
100105079

100106000	Very well.

100106009	
100106010	Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
100107000	Forgive me. I've been...testing you.
100107001	
100107002	
100107003	
100107004	
100107005	
100107006	
100107007	
100107008	
100107009	
100107010	To determine if the Elden Ring would truly have you.
100107011

100107013	
100107014	
100107015

100107017	
100107018	
100107019	
100107020	If you had the mettle to endure this long and arduous path.

100120048	
100120049	
100120050	I am Melina, and I have an accord with this person.

100120059	
100120060	We might be together for some time.
100120061	
100120062	
100120063	
100120064	
100120065	
100120066	
100120067	
100120068	
100120069	
100120070	Pleased to meet you.
100121000	...
100121001	
100121002	
100121003	
100121004	
100121005	
100121006	
100121007	
100121008	
100121009	
100121010	Is there...another person inside of you?
100121011	
100121012	
100121013	
100121014	
100121015	
100121016	
100121017	
100121018	
100121019	
100121020	Did you...want that to happen?
100121021	
100121022	
100121023	
100121024	
100121025	
100121026	
100121027	
100121028	
100121029	
100121030	I sense no malice. Do as you think best.
100121031	
100121032	
100121033	
100121034	
100121035	
100121036	
100121037	
100121038	
100121039	
100121040	Hello, other you.
100121041	
100121042	
100121043	
100121044	
100121045	
100121046	
100121047	
100121048	
100121049	
100121050	I am Melina, and I am travelling with this person.
100121051	
100121052	
100121053	
100121054	
100121055	
100121056	
100121057	
100121058	
100121059	
100121060	We might be together for some time.
100121061	
100121062	
100121063	
100121064	
100121065	
100121066	
100121067	
100121068	
100121069	
100121070	Pleased to meet you.
100130000	The Erdtree...is close.
100130001	
100130002	
100130003	
100130004	
100130005	
100130006	
100130007	
100130008	
100130009	
100130010	Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled.
100130011	
100130012	
100130013	
100130014	
100130015	
100130016	
100130017	
100130018	
100130019	
100130020	It takes me back.
100130021	
100130022	
100130023	
100130024	
100130025	
100130026	
100130027	
100130028	
100130029	
100130030	I was born at the foot of the Erdtree.
100130031	
100130032	
100130033	
100130034	
100130035	
100130036	
100130037	
100130038	
100130039	
100130040	Where mother gave me my purpose.
100130041	
100130042	
100130043	
100130044	
100130045	
100130046	
100130047	
100130048	
100130049	
100130050	Though now, everything is lost to me.
100130051	
100130052	
100130053	
100130054	
100130055	
100130056	
100130057	
100130058	
100130059	
100130060	I...have to ascertain for myself.
100130061	
100130062	
100130063	
100130064	
100130065	
100130066	
100130067	
100130068	
100130069	
100130070	The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.
100131000	My utmost thanks.
100131001	
100131002	
100131003	
100131004	
100131005	
100131006	
100131007	
100131008	
100131009	
100131010	For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree.
100131011	
100131012	
100131013	
100131014	
100131015	
100131016	
100131017	
100131018	
100131019	
100131020	Here, I can govern my own movement.
100131021	
100131022	
100131023	
100131024	
100131025	
100131026	
100131027	
100131028	
100131029	
100131030	And thus, the accord is fulfilled.
100131031	
100131032	
100131033	
100131034	
100131035	
100131036	
100131037	
100131038	
100131039	
100131040	I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given.
100131041	
100131042	
100131043	
100131044	
100131045	
100131046	
100131047	
100131048	
100131049	
100131050	Farewell.
100131051	
100131052	
100131053	
100131054	
100131055	
100131056	
100131057	
100131058	
100131059	
100131060	I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you.
100131061	
100131062	
100131063	
100131064	
100131065	
100131066	
100131067	
100131068	
100131069	
100131070	I wish you luck, in realising your ambition.
100131071	
100131072	
100131073	
100131074	
100131075	
100131076	
100131077	
100131078	
100131079	
100131080	You have fought long and hard.
100131081	
100131082	
100131083	
100131084	
100131085	
100131086	
100131087	
100131088	
100131089	
100131090	I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.
100140000	Hello again, old friend.
100140001	
100140002	
100140003	
100140004	
100140005	
100140006	
100140007	
100140008	
100140009	
100140010	It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion.
100140011	
100140012	
100140013	
100140014	
100140015	
100140016	
100140017	
100140018	
100140019	
100140020	Allow me a moment to converse with you.
100140021	
100140022	
100140023	
100140024	
100140025	
100140026	
100140027	
100140028	
100140029	
100140030	You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no?
100140031	
100140032	
100140033	
100140034	
100140035	
100140036	
100140037	
100140038	
100140039	
100140040	Prevented by the mantle of barbs.
100140041	
100140042	
100140043	
100140044	
100140045	
100140046	
100140047	
100140048	
100140049	
100140050	The thorns are impenetrable.
100140051	
100140052	
100140053	
100140054	
100140055	
100140056	
100140057	
100140058	
100140059	
100140060	A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without.
100140061	
100140062	
100140063	
100140064	
100140065	
100140066	
100140067	
100140068	
100140069	
100140070	The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...
100140071	
100140072	
100140073	
100140074	
100140075	
100140076	
100140077	
100140078	
100140079	
100140080	and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns.
100140081	
100140082	
100140083	
100140084	
100140085	
100140086	
100140087	
100140088	
100140089	
100140090	My purpose serves to aid in that very act.
100140091	
100140092	
100140093	
100140094	
100140095	
100140096	
100140097	
100140098	
100140099	
100140100	So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.
100140101	
100140102	
100140103	
100140104	
100140105	
100140106	
100140107	
100140108	
100140109	
100140110	To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
100140111	
100140112	
100140113	
100140114	
100140115	
100140116	
100140117	
100140118	
100140119	
100140120	Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.
100140121	
100140122	
100140123	
100140124	
100140125	
100140126	
100140127	
100140128	
100140129	
100140130	And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.
100141000	I wish to journey with you once more.
100141001	
100141002	
100141003	
100141004	
100141005	
100141006	
100141007	
100141008	
100141009	
100141010	To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
100141011	
100141012	
100141013	
100141014	
100141015	
100141016	
100141017	
100141018	
100141019	
100141020	Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.
100141021	
100141022	
100141023	
100141024	
100141025	
100141026	
100141027	
100141028	
100141029	
100141030	And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.
100150000	Think not, of the kindling.
100150001	
100150002	
100150003	
100150004	
100150005	
100150006	
100150007	
100150008	
100150009	
100150010	I shall see to that.
100150011	
100150012	
100150013	
100150014	
100150015	
100150016	
100150017	
100150018	
100150019	
100150020	All I ask of you is to make the journey.
100150021	
100150022	
100150023	
100150024	
100150025	
100150026	
100150027	
100150028	
100150029	
100150030	To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.
100150031	
100150032	
100150033	
100150034	
100150035	
100150036	
100150037	
100150038	
100150039	
100150040	I know...
100150041	
100150042	
100150043	
100150044	
100150045	
100150046	
100150047	
100150048	
100150049	
100150050	I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.
100150051	
100150052	
100150053	
100150054	
100150055	
100150056	
100150057	
100150058	
100150059	
100150060	But it must be done to reach the path beyond.
100150061	
100150062	
100150063	
100150064	
100150065	
100150066	
100150067	
100150068	
100150069	
100150070	And that is the path I wish to travel.
100150071	
100150072	
100150073	
100150074	
100150075	
100150076	
100150077	
100150078	
100150079	
100150080	What is your mind?
100160000	There is something I'd like to say.
100160001	
100160002	
100160003	
100160004	
100160005	
100160006	
100160007	
100160008	
100160009	
100160010	My purpose was given to me by my mother.
100160011	
100160012	
100160013	
100160014	
100160015	
100160016	
100160017	
100160018	
100160019	
100160020	But now, I act of my own volition.
100160021	
100160022	
100160023	
100160024	
100160025	
100160026	
100160027	
100160028	
100160029	
100160030	I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.
100160031	
100160032	
100160033	
100160034	
100160035	
100160036	
100160037	
100160038	
100160039	
100160040	Regardless of my mother's designs.
100160041	
100160042	
100160043	
100160044	
100160045	
100160046	
100160047	
100160048	
100160049	
100160050	I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.
100160051	
100160052	
100160053	
100160054	
100160055	
100160056	
100160057	
100160058	
100160059	
100160060	Not even you.
100170000	We're almost there.
100170001	
100170002	
100170003	
100170004	
100170005	
100170006	
100170007	
100170008	
100170009	
100170010	The flame of ruin lies just ahead.
100170011	
100170012	
100170013	
100170014	
100170015	
100170016	
100170017	
100170018	
100170019	
100170020	I'm glad it was you I travelled with.
100170021	
100170022	
100170023	
100170024	
100170025	
100170026	
100170027	
100170028

100171000	I have long observed the Lands Between.

100171007	
100171008	
100171009	
100171010	This world is in dire need of repair...
100171011	
100171012	
100171013	
100171014	
100171015	
100171016	
100171017	
100171018	
100171019	
100171020	and Death...indiscriminate...
100171021	
100171022	
100171023	
100171024	
100171025

100171027	
100171028	
100171029	
100171030	Are you prepared...
100171031	
100171032	
100171033	
100171034	
100171035	
100171036	
100171037	
100171038	
100171039	
100171040	To commit a cardinal sin?
100172000	Very well.
100172001	
100172002	
100172003	
100172004	
100172005	
100172006	
100172007	
100172008	
100172009	
100172010	Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
100173000	Very well.
100173001	
100173002	
100173003	
100173004	
100173005	
100173006	
100173007	
100173008	
100173009	
100173010	Tell me, when you are fully prepared.
100174000	Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin?
100180000	If you intend to claim the frenzied flame,
100180001	
100180002	
100180003	
100180004	
100180005	
100180006	
100180007	
100180008	
100180009	
100180010	I ask that you cease.
100180011	
100180012	
100180013	
100180014	
100180015	
100180016	
100180017	
100180018	
100180019	
100180020	It is not to be meddled with.
100180021	
100180022	
100180023	
100180024	
100180025	
100180026	
100180027	
100180028	
100180029	
100180030	It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.
100180031	
100180032	
100180033	
100180034	
100180035	
100180036	
100180037	
100180038	
100180039	
100180040	However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair...
100180041	
100180042	
100180043	
100180044	
100180045	
100180046	
100180047	
100180048	
100180049	
100180050	Life endures. Births continue.
100180051	
100180052	
100180053	
100180054	
100180055	
100180056	
100180057	
100180058	
100180059	
100180060	There is beauty in that, is there not?
100180061	
100180062	
100180063	
100180064	
100180065	
100180066	
100180067	
100180068	
100180069	
100180070	If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.
100180071	
100180072	
100180073	
100180074	
100180075	
100180076	
100180077	
100180078	
100180079	
100180080	Please, leave the frenzied flame alone.
100181000	I shall see to the kindling.
100181001	
100181002	
100181003	
100181004	
100181005	
100181006	
100181007	
100181008	
100181009	
100181010	It is a purpose which I choose to fulfil.
100181011	
100181012	
100181013	
100181014	
100181015	
100181016	
100181017	
100181018	
100181019	
100181020	So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.
100182000	The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with.
100182001	
100182002	
100182003	
100182004	
100182005	
100182006	
100182007	
100182008	
100182009	
100182010	It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.
100182011	
100182012	
100182013	
100182014	
100182015	
100182016	
100182017	
100182018	
100182019	
100182020	So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.
100185000	I ask you, one more time.
100185001	
100185002	
100185003	
100185004	
100185005	
100185006	
100185007	
100185008	
100185009	
100185010	Please, seek not the frenzied flame.
100185011	
100185012	
100185013	
100185014	
100185015	
100185016	
100185017	
100185018	
100185019	
100185020	As one who strives to become a Lord,
100185021	
100185022	
100185023	
100185024	
100185025	
100185026	
100185027	
100185028	
100185029	
100185030	deny not the lives, the new births of this world.
100185031	
100185032	
100185033	
100185034	
100185035	
100185036	
100185037	
100185038	
100185039	
100185040	Those who would are not fit to be called Lord.
100185041	
100185042	
100185043	
100185044	
100185045	
100185046	
100185047	
100185048	
100185049	
100185050	When the land they preside over is lifeless.
100186000	Please, put a stop to this madness.
100186001	
100186002	
100186003	
100186004	
100186005	
100186006	
100186007	
100186008	
100186009	
100186010	The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all.
100186011	
100186012	
100186013	
100186014	
100186015	
100186016	
100186017	
100186018	
100186019	
100186020	When the land they preside over is lifeless.
100190000	You...have inherited the frenzied flame.
100190001	
100190002	
100190003	
100190004	
100190005	
100190006	
100190007	
100190008	
100190009	
100190010	A pity. You are no longer fit.
100190011	
100190012	
100190013	
100190014	
100190015

100190017	
100190018	
100190019	
100190020	Our accord ends here.

100190044	
100190045

100190047	
100190048	
100190049	
100190050	I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.

100190057	
100190058	
100190059	
100190060	Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.

101003068	
101003069	
101003070	This is a path you must forsake.
101003071	
101003072	
101003073	
101003074	
101003075	
101003076	
101003077	
101003078	
101003079	
101003080	Dread awaits you in the south. Blackest dread!
101010000	Dragon slayer...
101010001	
101010002	
101010003	
101010004	
101010005	
101010006	
101010007	
101010008	
101010009	
101010010	Ohhh, dragon slayer...
101010011	
101010012	
101010013	
101010014	
101010015	
101010016	
101010017	
101010018	
101010019	
101010020	You unfeeling barbarian.
101010021	
101010022	
101010023	
101010024	
101010025	
101010026	
101010027	
101010028	
101010029	
101010030	Planning to feast? On dragon?
101010031	
101010032	
101010033	
101010034	
101010035	
101010036	
101010037	
101010038	
101010039	
101010040	At an abandoned church on that wee isle.
101010041	
101010042	
101010043	
101010044	
101010045	
101010046	
101010047	
101010048	
101010049	
101010050	You would devour the heart of an ancient?
101010051	
101010052	
101010053	
101010054	
101010055	
101010056	
101010057	
101010058	
101010059	
101010060	You wretched, undeserving brute!
101050000	Oh, bless you.
101050001	
101050002	
101050003	
101050004	
101050005	
101050006	
101050007	
101050008	
101050009	
101050010	Oh..ohh!
101050011	
101050012	
101050013	
101050014	
101050015	
101050016	
101050017	
101050018	
101050019	
101050020	Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished...
101050021	
101050022	
101050023	
101050024	
101050025	
101050026	
101050027	
101050028	
101050029	
101050030	Traverse Raya Lucaria; "Glintstone Eventide"…
101050031	
101050032	
101050033	
101050034	
101050035	
101050036	
101050037	
101050038	
101050039	
101050040	…and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift.
101050041	
101050042	
101050043	
101050044	
101050045	
101050046	
101050047	
101050048	
101050049	
101050050	Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed.
101050051	
101050052	
101050053	
101050054	
101050055	
101050056	
101050057	
101050058	
101050059	
101050060	Only, why should that matter!
101050061	
101050062	
101050063	
101050064	
101050065	
101050066	
101050067	
101050068	
101050069	
101050070	Stormveil Castle still stands tall!
101060000	Oh, bless you.
101060001	
101060002	
101060003	
101060004

101060027	
101060028	
101060029	
101060030	Miquella's favour can be yours…
101060031	
101060032	
101060033	
101060034	
101060035	
101060036	
101060037	
101060038	
101060039	
101060040	Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The all-hearing slaughtered, but alas, it was for naught.
101060041	
101060042	
101060043	
101060044	
101060045	
101060046	
101060047	
101060048	
101060049	
101060050	But all you need do, is snatch it from the big pot.
101060051	
101060052	
101060053	
101060054	
101060055

101060067	
101060068	
101060069	
101060070	Pity the poor, poor fool!
101070000	Oh, bless you.
101070001	
101070002	
101070003	
101070004

101070027	
101070028	
101070029	
101070030	…Are you one for festivals? Or flowers?
101070031	
101070032	
101070033	
101070034	
101070035	
101070036	
101070037	
101070038	
101070039	
101070040	To the South, a grand festival to make the stars turn.
101070041	
101070042	
101070043	
101070044	
101070045	
101070046	
101070047	
101070048	
101070049	
101070050	To the East, the hardened bud of a flower to be.
101070051	
101070052	
101070053	
101070054	
101070055	
101070056	
101070057	
101070058	
101070059	
101070060	But dare you enter?
101070061	
101070062	
101070063	
101070064	
101070065	
101070066	
101070067	
101070068	
101070069	
101070070	Into the heart of the scarlet rot?
101070071	
101070072	
101070073	
101070074	
101070075	
101070076	
101070077	
101070078	
101070079	
101070080	Ah...ahhh...
101080000	What a pity it is, to be without the right.
101080001	
101080002	
101080003	
101080004	
101080005	
101080006	
101080007	
101080008	
101080009	
101080010	All you can do is stand, at a loss.
101080011	
101080012	
101080013	
101080014	
101080015	
101080016	
101080017	
101080018	
101080019	
101080020	Without even the half crescents that wish to be whole.
101080021	
101080022	
101080023	
101080024	
101080025	
101080026	
101080027	
101080028	
101080029	
101080030	Before the unmoving, unfeeling Grand Lift ahead.
101080031	
101080032	
101080033	
101080034	
101080035

101080045	
101080046	
101080047	
101080048	
101080049	
101080050	Or, are you planning to throw yourself to the waters?
101080051	
101080052	
101080053	
101080054	
101080055	
101080056	
101080057	
101080058	
101080059	
101080060	To find the coward's passage, through the dim cavern?
101080061	
101080062	
101080063	
101080064	
101080065	
101080066	
101080067	
101080068	
101080069	
101080070	What a pity it is, to be without the right.
101081000	Oh, bless you...
101081001	
101081002	
101081003	
101081004	
101081005	
101081006	
101081007	
101081008	
101081009	
101081010	Bless you...

101081026	
101081027	
101081028	
101081029	
101081030	You. The one who holds both half crescents.
101081031	
101081032	
101081033	
101081034	
101081035	
101081036	
101081037	
101081038	
101081039	
101081040	Take the path to the Grand Lift ahead.
101081041	
101081042	
101081043	
101081044	
101081045	
101081046	
101081047	
101081048	
101081049	
101081050	For you...are the one who will be Lord.

101081067	
101081068	
101081069	
101081070	Bear witness, one and all! The Lord is returned!

101081074	
101081075

101081077	
101081078	
101081079	
101081080	The Elden Lord is come again!
101090000	Oh, bless you...

101090026	
101090027	
101090028	
101090029	
101090030	To the east...ruins of gold. To the west...the serpent's sacrilege.
101090031	
101090032	
101090033	
101090034	
101090035

101090037	
101090038

101090040	Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow.

101090047	
101090048	
101090049	
101090050	Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow.
101090051	
101090052	
101090053	
101090054	
101090055	
101090056	
101090057	
101090058	
101090059	
101090060	Tis a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika!
101090061	
101090062	
101090063	
101090064

101090068	
101090069	
101090070	Ah...ahh... Ha...ha...
101100000	The Fingers I served once prophesied...
101100001	
101100002	
101100003	
101100004	
101100005	
101100006	
101100007	
101100008	
101100009	
101100010	A Tarnished would one day become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.

101100037	
101100038	
101100039	
101100040	The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.

101100066	
101100067	
101100068	
101100069	
101100070	And whatever you might face...
101100071	
101100072	
101100073	
101100074	
101100075	
101100076	
101100077	
101100078	
101100079	
101100080	The Fingers will surely guide you...
101110000	Turn back.
101110001	
101110002	
101110003	
101110004	
101110005	
101110006	
101110007	
101110008	
101110009	
101110010	Ahead lies the Land of the Giants' Flame.
101110011	
101110012	
101110013	
101110014	
101110015	
101110016	
101110017	
101110018	
101110019	
101110020	And the way forth is forbidden.
101110021	
101110022	
101110023	
101110024	
101110025	
101110026	
101110027	
101110028	
101110029	
101110030	...
101110031	
101110032	
101110033	
101110034	
101110035	
101110036	
101110037	
101110038	
101110039	
101110040	Hear me. The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.
101110041	
101110042	
101110043	
101110044	
101110045	
101110046	
101110047	
101110048	
101110049	
101110050	Doing so will unbind Destined Death, and slay the world itself.
101110051	
101110052	
101110053	
101110054	
101110055	
101110056	
101110057	
101110058	
101110059	
101110060	...
101110061	
101110062	
101110063	
101110064	
101110065	
101110066	
101110067	
101110068	
101110069	
101110070	Who would dare put you up to such a task?
101110071	
101110072	
101110073	
101110074	
101110075	
101110076	
101110077	
101110078	
101110079	
101110080	Most certainly not the Fingers!
101120000	Ohh...
101120001	
101120002	
101120003	
101120004	
101120005	
101120006	
101120007	
101120008	
101120009	
101120010	Oh, Lord Godwyn...
101120011	
101120012	
101120013	
101120014	
101120015	
101120016	
101120017	
101120018	
101120019	
101120020	Such cruelty, such humiliation...
101120021	
101120022	
101120023	
101120024	
101120025	
101120026	
101120027	
101120028	
101120029	
101120030	My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.
101120031	
101120032	
101120033	
101120034	
101120035	
101120036	
101120037	
101120038	
101120039	
101120040	As the first of the demigods to die.
101120041	
101120042	
101120043	
101120044	
101120045	
101120046	
101120047	
101120048	
101120049	
101120050	As a martyr to Destined Death.
101120051	
101120052	
101120053	
101120054	
101120055	
101120056	
101120057	
101120058	
101120059	
101120060	But why must it yet bring such disgrace?
101120061	
101120062	
101120063	
101120064	
101120065	
101120066	
101120067	
101120068	
101120069	
101120070	A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...
101120071	
101120072	
101120073	
101120074	
101120075	
101120076	
101120077	
101120078	
101120079	
101120080	How could such a thing come to be...
101120081	
101120082	
101120083	
101120084	
101120085

101120087	
101120088	
101120089	
101120090	<sobbing>
101121000	Ohh...
101121001	
101121002	
101121003	
101121004	
101121005	
101121006	
101121007	
101121008	
101121009	
101121010	Oh, Lord Godwyn...
101121011	
101121012	
101121013	
101121014	
101121015	
101121016	
101121017	
101121018	
101121019	
101121020	My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.
101121021	
101121022	
101121023	
101121024	
101121025	
101121026	
101121027	
101121028	
101121029	
101121030	A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...

101121033	
101121034	
101121035	
101121036	
101121037	
101121038	
101121039	
101121040	How could such a thing come to be...
101121041	
101121042	
101121043	
101121044	
101121045	
101121046	
101121047	
101121048	
101121049	
101121050	<sobbing>
101800000	Ha, ha, ha!
101801000	A curse! A curse upon you!
101801001	
101801002	
101801003	
101801004	
101801005	
101801006	
101801007	
101801008	
101801009	
101801010	Your path leads only to death!
101802000	You godless brute.
101802001	
101802002	
101802003	
101802004	
101802005	
101802006	
101802007	
101802008	
101802009	
101802010	You'll soil your hands soon enough.
101802011	
101802012	
101802013	
101802014	
101802015	
101802016	
101802017	
101802018	
101802019	
101802020	With mortal sin!
102001000	Are you that new Tarnished?
102001001	
102001002	
102001003	
102001004	
102001005	
102001006	
102001007	
102001008	
102001009	
102001010	You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader.
102001011	
102001012	
102001013	
102001014	
102001015	
102001016	
102001017	
102001018	
102001019	
102001020	I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.
102001021	
102001022	
102001023	
102001024	
102001025	
102001026	
102001027	
102001028	
102001029	
102001030	Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer.
102001031	
102001032	
102001033	
102001034	
102001035	
102001036	
102001037	
102001038	
102001039	
102001040	Let their wisdom wash over you.
102001041	
102001042	
102001043	
102001044	
102001045	
102001046	
102001047	
102001048	
102001049	
102001050	"Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order."
102001051	
102001052	
102001053	
102001054	
102001055	
102001056	
102001057	
102001058	
102001059	
102001060	"Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy."
102001061	
102001062	
102001063	
102001064	
102001065	
102001066	
102001067	
102001068	
102001069	
102001070	"Until it was shattered."
102001071	
102001072	
102001073	
102001074	
102001075	
102001076	
102001077	
102001078	
102001079	
102001080	"The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll."
102001081	
102001082	
102001083	
102001084	
102001085	
102001086	
102001087	
102001088	
102001089	
102001090	"Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces."
102001091	
102001092	
102001093	
102001094	
102001095	
102001096	
102001097	
102001098	
102001099	
102001100	"Foul curses and misery spread, unabating."
102001101	
102001102	
102001103	
102001104	
102001105	
102001106	
102001107	
102001108	
102001109	
102001110	"But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it."
102001111	
102001112	
102001113	
102001114	
102001115	
102001116	
102001117	
102001118	
102001119	
102001120	"So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act."
102001121	
102001122	
102001123	
102001124	
102001125	
102001126	
102001127	
102001128	
102001129	
102001130	"Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring."
102001131	
102001132	
102001133	
102001134	
102001135	
102001136	
102001137	
102001138	
102001139	
102001140	"Seek another of its kind."
102001141	
102001142	
102001143	
102001144	
102001145	
102001146	
102001147	
102001148	
102001149	
102001150	"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."
102001170	Let the words of the Fingers guide you.
102002000	Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods;
102002001	
102002002	
102002003	
102002004	
102002005	
102002006	
102002007	
102002008	
102002009	
102002010	the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring.
102002011	
102002012	
102002013	
102002014	
102002015	
102002016	
102002017	
102002018	
102002019	
102002020	Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord.
102002021	
102002022	
102002023	
102002024	
102002025	
102002026	
102002027	
102002028	
102002029	
102002030	And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished.
102002031	
102002032	
102002033	
102002034	
102002035	
102002036	
102002037	
102002038	
102002039	
102002040	Listen, the Fingers speak.
102002041	
102002042	
102002043	
102002044	
102002045	
102002046	
102002047	
102002048	
102002049	
102002050	"The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods."
102002051	
102002052	
102002053	
102002054	
102002055	
102002056	
102002057	
102002058	
102002059	
102002060	"Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left."
102002061	
102002062	
102002063	
102002064	
102002065	
102002066	
102002067	
102002068	
102002069	
102002070	"The Fingers have willed it so."
102002071	
102002072	
102002073	
102002074	
102002075	
102002076	
102002077	
102002078	
102002079	
102002080	...Indeed. But remember one thing.
102002081	
102002082	
102002083	
102002084	
102002085	
102002086	
102002087	
102002088	
102002089	
102002090	The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.
102002091	
102002092	
102002093	
102002094	
102002095	
102002096	
102002097	
102002098	
102002099	
102002100	Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation...
102002101	
102002102	
102002103	
102002104	
102002105	
102002106	
102002107	
102002108	
102002109	
102002110	The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted.
102003000	Well, well… I see…
102003001	
102003002	
102003003	
102003004	
102003005	
102003006	
102003007	
102003008	
102003009	
102003010	A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession.
102003011	
102003012	
102003013	
102003014	
102003015	
102003016	
102003017	
102003018	
102003019	
102003020	Demigods, and even the greater of the champions,
102003021	
102003022	
102003023	
102003024	
102003025	
102003026	
102003027	
102003028	
102003029	
102003030	are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.
102003031	
102003032	
102003033	
102003034	
102003035	
102003036	
102003037	
102003038	
102003039	
102003040	They are…valuable indeed.
102003041	
102003042	
102003043	
102003044	
102003045	
102003046	
102003047	
102003048	
102003049	
102003050	These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters.
102003051	
102003052	
102003053	
102003054	
102003055	
102003056	
102003057	
102003058	
102003059	
102003060	And should you wish to wield that same power, well…
102003061	
102003062	
102003063	
102003064	
102003065	
102003066	
102003067	
102003068	
102003069	
102003070	I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.
102003071	
102003072	
102003073	
102003074	
102003075	
102003076	
102003077	
102003078	
102003079	
102003080	Heh… Do not recoil from my offer.
102003081	
102003082	
102003083	
102003084	
102003085	
102003086	
102003087	
102003088	
102003089	
102003090	The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?
102004000	Ah. You have returned. What is it?
102005000	Now, go forth.
102005001	
102005002	
102005003	
102005004	
102005005	
102005006	
102005007	
102005008	
102005009	
102005010	Let the words of the Fingers guide you.
102010000	I had my doubts, but...my, look at you.
102010001	
102010002	
102010003	
102010004	
102010005	
102010006	
102010007	
102010008	
102010009	
102010010	Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.
102010011	
102010012	
102010013	
102010014	
102010015	
102010016	
102010017	
102010018	
102010019	
102010020	Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.
102010021	
102010022	
102010023	
102010024	
102010025	
102010026	
102010027	
102010028	
102010029	
102010030	"Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased."
102010031	
102010032	
102010033	
102010034	
102010035	
102010036	
102010037	
102010038	
102010039	
102010040	"You have earned the right to become Elden Lord."
102010041	
102010042	
102010043	
102010044	
102010045	
102010046	
102010047	
102010048	
102010049	
102010050	"Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika."
102010051	
102010052	
102010053	
102010054	
102010055	
102010056	
102010057	
102010058	
102010059	
102010060	"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."
102010061	
102010062	
102010063	
102010064	
102010065	
102010066	
102010067	
102010068	
102010069	
102010070	The Fingers expect...
102010071	
102010072	
102010073	
102010074	
102010075	
102010076	
102010077	
102010078	
102010079	
102010080	As much from you as they do young Gideon.
102010081	
102010082	
102010083	
102010084	
102010085	
102010086	
102010087	
102010088	
102010089	
102010090	Take this. A token of farewell.
102011000	Now, go forth.
102011001	
102011002	
102011003	
102011004	
102011005	
102011006	
102011007	
102011008	
102011009	
102011010	Become Elden Lord.
102012000	Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.
102012001	
102012002	
102012003	
102012004	
102012005	
102012006	
102012007	
102012008	
102012009	
102012010	A god, in truth.
102012011	
102012012	
102012013	
102012014	
102012015	
102012016	
102012017	
102012018	
102012019	
102012020	But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.
102012021	
102012022	
102012023	
102012024	
102012025	
102012026	
102012027	
102012028	
102012029	
102012030	A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood.
102012031	
102012032	
102012033	
102012034	
102012035	
102012036	
102012037	
102012038	
102012039	
102012040	The Fingers speak...
102012041	
102012042	
102012043	
102012044	
102012045	
102012046	
102012047	
102012048	
102012049	
102012050	"Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence."
102012051	
102012052	
102012053	
102012054	
102012055	
102012056	
102012057	
102012058	
102012059	
102012060	"But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel."
102012061	
102012062	
102012063	
102012064	
102012065	
102012066	
102012067	
102012068	
102012069	
102012070	"Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort."
102012071	
102012072	
102012073	
102012074	
102012075	
102012076	
102012077	
102012078	
102012079	
102012080	"The Fingers have willed it so."
102012081	
102012082	
102012083	
102012084	
102012085	
102012086	
102012087	
102012088	
102012089	
102012090	Now, you may go.
102020000	Well, you managed to return.
102020001	
102020002	
102020003	
102020004	
102020005	
102020006	
102020007	
102020008	
102020009	
102020010	You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.
102020011	
102020012	
102020013	
102020014	
102020015	
102020016	
102020017	
102020018	
102020019	
102020020	The Fingers remain still.
102020021	
102020022	
102020023	
102020024	
102020025	
102020026	
102020027	
102020028	
102020029	
102020030	Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.
102020031	
102020032	
102020033	
102020034	
102020035	
102020036	
102020037	
102020038	
102020039	
102020040	When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance.
102020041	
102020042	
102020043	
102020044	
102020045	
102020046	
102020047	
102020048	
102020049	
102020050	But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.
102020051	
102020052	
102020053	
102020054	
102020055	
102020056	
102020057	
102020058	
102020059	
102020060	No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait...
102020061	
102020062	
102020063	
102020064	
102020065	
102020066	
102020067	
102020068	
102020069	
102020070	My, oh, my...
102021000	It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance.
102021001	
102021002	
102021003	
102021004	
102021005	
102021006	
102021007	
102021008	
102021009	
102021010	My, oh, my. Whatever will you do…
102030000	Heavens forbid...
102030001	
102030002	
102030003	
102030004	
102030005	
102030006	
102030007	
102030008	
102030009	
102030010	That is not the domain of mere men.
102030011	
102030012	
102030013	
102030014	
102030015	
102030016	
102030017	
102030018	
102030019	
102030020	The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too?
102030021	
102030022	
102030023	
102030024	
102030025	
102030026	
102030027	
102030028	
102030029	
102030030	The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.
102030031	
102030032	
102030033	
102030034	
102030035	
102030036	
102030037	
102030038	
102030039	
102030040	The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation…
102030041	
102030042	
102030043	
102030044	
102030045	
102030046	
102030047	
102030048	
102030049	
102030050	Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...
102030051	
102030052	
102030053	
102030054	
102030055	
102030056	
102030057	
102030058	
102030059	
102030060	The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.
102030061	
102030062	
102030063	
102030064	
102030065	
102030066	
102030067	
102030068	
102030069	
102030070	...
102030071	
102030072	
102030073	
102030074	
102030075	
102030076	
102030077	
102030078	
102030079	
102030080	...
102030081	
102030082	
102030083	
102030084	
102030085	
102030086	
102030087	
102030088	
102030089	
102030090	But here we are...
102030091	
102030092	
102030093	
102030094	
102030095	
102030096	
102030097	
102030098	
102030099	
102030100	The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.
102030101	
102030102	
102030103	
102030104	
102030105	
102030106	
102030107	
102030108	
102030109	
102030110	The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.
102030111	
102030112	
102030113	
102030114	
102030115	
102030116	
102030117	
102030118	
102030119	
102030120	Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?
102030121	
102030122	
102030123	
102030124	
102030125	
102030126	
102030127	
102030128	
102030129	
102030130	Go on. Finish the job.
102030131	
102030132	
102030133	
102030134	
102030135	
102030136	
102030137	
102030138	
102030139	
102030140	Take the course you deem most worthy.
102031000	You must find kindling.
102031001	
102031002	
102031003	
102031004	
102031005	
102031006	
102031007	
102031008	
102031009	
102031010	Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.
102031011	
102031012	
102031013	
102031014	
102031015	
102031016	
102031017	
102031018	
102031019	
102031020	But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.
102031021	
102031022	
102031023	
102031024	
102031025	
102031026	
102031027	
102031028	
102031029	
102031030	For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.
102031031	
102031032	
102031033	
102031034	
102031035	
102031036	
102031037	
102031038	
102031039	
102031040	And can lead you to the Rune of Death.
102040000	You've done it, I see.
102040001	
102040002	
102040003	
102040004	
102040005	
102040006	
102040007	
102040008	
102040009	
102040010	What use do you have for me, now?
102040011	
102040012	
102040013	
102040014	
102040015	
102040016	
102040017	
102040018	
102040019	
102040020	I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again.
102040021	
102040022	
102040023	
102040024	
102040025	
102040026	
102040027	
102040028	
102040029	
102040030	Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you.
102040031	
102040032	
102040033	
102040034	
102040035	
102040036	
102040037	
102040038	
102040039	
102040040	Now, you may go.
102041000	Heh, heh, heh.
102041001	
102041002	
102041003	
102041004	
102041005	
102041006	
102041007	
102041008	
102041009	
102041010	You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now?
102041011	
102041012	
102041013	
102041014	
102041015	
102041016	
102041017	
102041018	
102041019	
102041020	A harder taskmaster have I never met.
102042000	Don't worry, my dear.
102042001	
102042002	
102042003	
102042004	
102042005	
102042006	
102042007	
102042008	
102042009	
102042010	I'll see it to the end with you, if it please.
102043000	Now, go forth.
102043001	
102043002	
102043003	
102043004	
102043005	
102043006	
102043007	
102043008	
102043009	
102043010	Do what you believe is right.
102100000	Oh, such a fine gift, I will gladly accept.
102100001	
102100002	
102100003	
102100004	
102100005	
102100006	
102100007	
102100008	
102100009	
102100010	But don't raise your hopes;
102100011	
102100012	
102100013	
102100014	
102100015	
102100016	
102100017	
102100018	
102100019	
102100020	I have no secrets for you to plunder.
102100021	
102100022	
102100023	
102100024	
102100025	
102100026	
102100027	
102100028	
102100029	
102100030	I lost my appetite for them a lifetime ago, or more.
102101000	<sleeping>
106001000	A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.
106001001	
106001002	
106001003	
106001004	
106001005	
106001006	
106001007	
106001008	
106001009	
106001010	I am the witch Renna.
106001011	
106001012	
106001013	
106001014	
106001015	
106001016	
106001017	
106001018	
106001019	
106001020	I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.
106001021	
106001022	
106001023	
106001024	
106001025	
106001026	
106001027	
106001028	
106001029	
106001030	And upon looking into the matter,
106001031	
106001032	
106001033	
106001034	
106001035	
106001036	
106001037	
106001038	
106001039	
106001040	the talk, I surmise, is of thee.
106001041	
106001042	
106001043	
106001044	
106001045	
106001046	
106001047	
106001048	
106001049	
106001050	Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?
106001051	
106001052	
106001053	
106001054	
106001055	
106001056	
106001057	
106001058	
106001059	
106001060	To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.
106002000	Ah. As I had hoped.
106002001	
106002002	
106002003	
106002004	
106002005	
106002006	
106002007	
106002008	
106002009	
106002010	I was entrusted this, for thee.
106002011	
106002012	
106002013	
106002014	
106002015	
106002016	
106002017	
106002018	
106002019	
106002020	By Torrent's former master.
106002021	
106002022	
106002023	
106002024	
106002025	
106002026	
106002027	
106002028	
106002029	
106002030	Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.
106002031	
106002032	
106002033	
106002034	
106002035	
106002036	
106002037	
106002038	
106002039	
106002040	Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.
106002041	
106002042	
106002043	
106002044	
106002045	
106002046	
106002047	
106002048	
106002049	
106002050	The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.
106002051	
106002052	
106002053	
106002054	
106002055	
106002056	
106002057	
106002058	
106002059	
106002060	Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.
106003000	Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.
106003001	
106003002	
106003003	
106003004	
106003005	
106003006	
106003007	
106003008	
106003009	
106003010	I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.
106003011	
106003012	
106003013	
106003014	
106003015	
106003016	
106003017	
106003018	
106003019	
106003020	How long will it be, I wonder...
106003021	
106003022	
106003023	
106003024	
106003025	
106003026	
106003027	
106003028	
106003029	
106003030	Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?
106003031	
106003032	
106003033	
106003034	
106003035	
106003036	
106003037	
106003038	
106003039	
106003040	...
106004000	This way, Tarnished.
106004001	
106004002	
106004003	
106004004	
106004005	
106004006	
106004007	
106004008	
106004009	
106004010	May I have a word?
106010000	Trifle not with me, Tarnished.
106010001	
106010002	
106010003	
106010004	
106010005	
106010006	
106010007	
106010008	
106010009	
106010010	Or didst thou merely forget?
106010011	
106010012	
106010013	
106010014	
106010015	
106010016	
106010017	
106010018	
106010019	
106010020	The name of the spectral steed thou callest?
106011000	I will ask thee again.
106011001	
106011002	
106011003	
106011004	
106011005	
106011006	
106011007	
106011008	
106011009	
106011010	Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?
106011011	
106011012	
106011013	
106011014	
106011015	
106011016	
106011017	
106011018	
106011019	
106011020	To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.
106012000	Quite the stubborn one, aren't we?
106012001	
106012002	
106012003	
106012004	
106012005	
106012006	
106012007	
106012008	
106012009	
106012010	Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty.
106012011	
106012012	
106012013	
106012014	
106012015	
106012016	
106012017	
106012018	
106012019	
106012020	Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit.
106012021	
106012022	
106012023	
106012024	
106012025	
106012026	
106012027	
106012028	
106012029	
106012030	I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master.
106012031	
106012032	
106012033	
106012034	
106012035	
106012036	
106012037	
106012038	
106012039	
106012040	Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion.
106012041	
106012042	
106012043	
106012044	
106012045	
106012046	
106012047	
106012048	
106012049	
106012050	...
106020000	What hopest thou to profit?
106020001	
106020002	
106020003	
106020004	
106020005	
106020006	
106020007	
106020008	
106020009	
106020010	...
106020011	
106020012	
106020013	
106020014	
106020015	
106020016	
106020017	
106020018	
106020019	
106020020	No sense in arguing, I see.
106020021	
106020022	
106020023	
106020024	
106020025	
106020026	
106020027	
106020028	
106020029	
106020030	Thou'rt a wild one, indeed.
106020031	
106020032	
106020033	
106020034	
106020035	
106020036	
106020037	
106020038	
106020039	
106020040	Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen...
106020041	
106020042	
106020043	
106020044	
106020045	
106020046	
106020047	
106020048	
106020049	
106020050	...
106030000	Let us speak of the past, a while.
106030001	
106030002	
106030003	
106030004	
106030005	
106030006	
106030007	
106030008	
106030009	
106030010	I was once an Empyrean.
106030011	
106030012	
106030013	
106030014	
106030015	
106030016	
106030017	
106030018	
106030019	
106030020	Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.
106030021	
106030022	
106030023	
106030024	
106030025	
106030026	
106030027	
106030028	
106030029	
106030030	Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.
106030031	
106030032	
106030033	
106030034	
106030035	
106030036	
106030037	
106030038	
106030039	
106030040	But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.
106030041	
106030042	
106030043	
106030044	
106030045	
106030046	
106030047	
106030048	
106030049	
106030050	I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.
106030051	
106030052	
106030053	
106030054	
106030055	
106030056	
106030057	
106030058	
106030059	
106030060	I would not be controlled by that thing.
106030061	
106030062	
106030063	
106030064	
106030065	
106030066	
106030067	
106030068	
106030069	
106030070	The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...
106030071	
106030072	
106030073	
106030074	
106030075	
106030076	
106030077	
106030078	
106030079	
106030080	And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
106101000	Oh, again we cross paths.
106101001	
106101002	
106101003	
106101004	
106101005	
106101006	
106101007	
106101008	
106101009	
106101010	I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.
106101011	
106101012	
106101013	
106101014	
106101015	
106101016	
106101017	
106101018	
106101019	
106101020	It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...
106101021	
106101022	
106101023	
106101024	
106101025	
106101026	
106101027	
106101028	
106101029	
106101030	But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?
106101031	
106101032	
106101033	
106101034	
106101035	
106101036	
106101037	
106101038	
106101039	
106101040	I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.
106102000	Mm? a Tarnished, here?
106102001	
106102002	
106102003	
106102004	
106102005	
106102006	
106102007	
106102008	
106102009	
106102010	Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way.
106102011	
106102012	
106102013	
106102014	
106102015	
106102016	
106102017	
106102018	
106102019	
106102020	Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.
106110000	I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.
106110001	
106110002	
106110003	
106110004	
106110005	
106110006	
106110007	
106110008	
106110009	
106110010	Indeed, I am the witch Ranni.
106110011	
106110012	
106110013	
106110014	
106110015	
106110016	
106110017	
106110018	
106110019	
106110020	I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.
106110021	
106110022	
106110023	
106110024	
106110025	
106110026	
106110027	
106110028	
106110029	
106110030	I did it all.
106110031	
106110032	
106110033	
106110034	
106110035	
106110036	
106110037	
106110038	
106110039	
106110040	But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.
106110041	
106110042	
106110043	
106110044	
106110045	
106110046	
106110047	
106110048	
106110049	
106110050	I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.
106110051	
106110052	
106110053	
106110054	
106110055	
106110056	
106110057	
106110058	
106110059	
106110060	And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.
106111000	Hah!
106111001	
106111002	
106111003	
106111004	
106111005	
106111006	
106111007	
106111008	
106111009	
106111010	And why should I reveal that to thee?
106111011	
106111012	
106111013	
106111014	
106111015	
106111016	
106111017	
106111018	
106111019	
106111020	I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,
106111021	
106111022	
106111023	
106111024	
106111025	
106111026	
106111027	
106111028	
106111029	
106111030	but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot.
106111031	
106111032	
106111033	
106111034	
106111035	
106111036	
106111037	
106111038	
106111039	
106111040	The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.
106111041	
106111042	
106111043	
106111044	
106111045	
106111046	
106111047	
106111048	
106111049	
106111050	Now, begone.
106112000	The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.
106112001	
106112002	
106112003	
106112004	
106112005	
106112006	
106112007	
106112008	
106112009	
106112010	Now, begone.
106113000	Oh, is that so?
106113001	
106113002	
106113003	
106113004	
106113005	
106113006	
106113007	
106113008	
106113009	
106113010	Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?
106113011	
106113012	
106113013	
106113014	
106113015	
106113016	
106113017	
106113018	
106113019	
106113020	Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?
106113021	
106113022	
106113023	
106113024	
106113025	
106113026	
106113027	
106113028	
106113029	
106113030	...
106113031	
106113032	
106113033	
106113034	
106113035	
106113036	
106113037	
106113038	
106113039	
106113040	Very well...
106113041	
106113042	
106113043	
106113044	
106113045	
106113046	
106113047	
106113048	
106113049	
106113050	There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.
106113051	
106113052	
106113053	
106113054	
106113055	
106113056	
106113057	
106113058	
106113059	
106113060	What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,
106113061	
106113062	
106113063	
106113064	
106113065	
106113066	
106113067	
106113068	
106113069	
106113070	I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...
106113071	
106113072	
106113073	
106113074	
106113075	
106113076	
106113077	
106113078	
106113079	
106113080	I'll allow it. Enter my service.
106113081	
106113082	
106113083	
106113084	
106113085	
106113086	
106113087	
106113088	
106113089	
106113090	And good hunting to thee.
106120000	Hah!
106120001	
106120002	
106120003	
106120004	
106120005	
106120006	
106120007	
106120008	
106120009	
106120010	No reason in particular, thou claimest?
106120011	
106120012	
106120013	
106120014	
106120015	
106120016	
106120017	
106120018	
106120019	
106120020	Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.
106120021	
106120022	
106120023	
106120024	
106120025	
106120026	
106120027	
106120028	
106120029	
106120030	Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter.
106120031	
106120032	
106120033	
106120034	
106120035	
106120036	
106120037	
106120038	
106120039	
106120040	...
106120041	
106120042	
106120043	
106120044	
106120045	
106120046	
106120047	
106120048	
106120049	
106120050	Wilt thou enter into my service?
106120051	
106120052	
106120053	
106120054	
106120055	
106120056	
106120057	
106120058	
106120059	
106120060	I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.
106120061	
106120062	
106120063	
106120064	
106120065	
106120066	
106120067	
106120068	
106120069	
106120070	That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.
106120071	
106120072	
106120073	
106120074	
106120075	
106120076	
106120077	
106120078	
106120079	
106120080	Well? Has that roused thy interest?
106121000	I see. A choice well made.
106121001	
106121002	
106121003	
106121004	
106121005	
106121006	
106121007	
106121008	
106121009	
106121010	Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.
106121011	
106121012	
106121013	
106121014	
106121015	
106121016	
106121017	
106121018	
106121019	
106121020	But I require as much of those under my command.
106121021	
106121022	
106121023	
106121024	
106121025	
106121026	
106121027	
106121028	
106121029	
106121030	I anticipate good work from thee.
106122000	I see. More's the pity.
106122001	
106122002	
106122003	
106122004	
106122005	
106122006	
106122007	
106122008	
106122009	
106122010	Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart.
106122011	
106122012	
106122013	
106122014	
106122015	
106122016	
106122017	
106122018	
106122019	
106122020	Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch...
106122021	
106122022	
106122023	
106122024	
106122025	
106122026	
106122027	
106122028	
106122029	
106122030	Is not as frightful as thou fearest...
106123000	Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause?
106123001	
106123002	
106123003	
106123004	
106123005	
106123006	
106123007	
106123008	
106123009	
106123010	Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service?
106130000	Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.
106130001	
106130002	
106130003	
106130004	
106130005	
106130006	
106130007	
106130008	
106130009	
106130010	There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.
106130011	
106130012	
106130013	
106130014	
106130015	
106130016	
106130017	
106130018	
106130019	
106130020	I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.
106130021	
106130022	
106130023	
106130024	
106130025	
106130026	
106130027	
106130028	
106130029	
106130030	I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.
106130031	
106130032	
106130033	
106130034	
106130035	
106130036	
106130037	
106130038	
106130039	
106130040	Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.
106130041	
106130042	
106130043	
106130044	
106130045	
106130046	
106130047	
106130048	
106130049	
106130050	Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.
106130051	
106130052	
106130053	
106130054	
106130055	
106130056	
106130057	
106130058	
106130059	
106130060	I am sure the others will be doing just the same.
106131000	Speak with the three who await thee below.
106131001	
106131002	
106131003	
106131004	
106131005	
106131006	
106131007	
106131008	
106131009	
106131010	Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.
106131011	
106131012	
106131013	
106131014	
106131015	
106131016	
106131017	
106131018	
106131019	
106131020	It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.
106135000	Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.
106135001	
106135002	
106135003	
106135004	
106135005	
106135006	
106135007	
106135008	
106135009	
106135010	Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave?
106135011	
106135012	
106135013	
106135014	
106135015	
106135016	
106135017	
106135018	
106135019	
106135020	It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron.
106135021	
106135022	
106135023	
106135024	
106135025	
106135026	
106135027	
106135028	
106135029	
106135030	Go there to find the city's hidden treasure.
106136000	Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below.
106136001	
106136002	
106136003	
106136004	
106136005	
106136006	
106136007	
106136008	
106136009	
106136010	Like thee, they are in my service.
106136011	
106136012	
106136013	
106136014	
106136015	
106136016	
106136017	
106136018	
106136019	
106136020	Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.
106136021	
106136022	
106136023	
106136024	
106136025	
106136026	
106136027	
106136028	
106136029	
106136030	I am sure the others will be doing just the same.
106137000	Speak with the three who await thee below.
106137001	
106137002	
106137003	
106137004	
106137005	
106137006	
106137007	
106137008	
106137009	
106137010	Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.
106137011	
106137012	
106137013	
106137014	
106137015	
106137016	
106137017	
106137018	
106137019	
106137020	It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.
106140000	Ah, allow me to forewarn thee.
106140001	
106140002	
106140003	
106140004	
106140005	
106140006	
106140007	
106140008	
106140009	
106140010	I shall soon enter my slumber.
106140011	
106140012	
106140013	
106140014	
106140015	
106140016	
106140017	
106140018	
106140019	
106140020	And it will be some time before I wake.
106140021	
106140022	
106140023	
106140024	
106140025	
106140026	
106140027	
106140028	
106140029	
106140030	This doll's body is not without its hindrances...
106140031	
106140032	
106140033	
106140034	
106140035	
106140036	
106140037	
106140038	
106140039	
106140040	Still, I have high hopes for thee.
106140041	
106140042	
106140043	
106140044	
106140045	
106140046	
106140047	
106140048	
106140049	
106140050	I look forward to the good news when I arise.
106141000	I shall soon enter my slumber.
106141001	
106141002	
106141003	
106141004	
106141005	
106141006	
106141007	
106141008	
106141009	
106141010	And it will be some time before I wake.
106141011	
106141012	
106141013	
106141014	
106141015	
106141016	
106141017	
106141018	
106141019	
106141020	I have high hopes for thee.
106141021	
106141022	
106141023	
106141024	
106141025	
106141026	
106141027	
106141028	
106141029	
106141030	I look forward to the good news when I arise.
106145000	...
106170000	Ahh...It was thee.
106170001	
106170002	
106170003	
106170004	
106170005	
106170006	
106170007	
106170008	
106170009	
106170010	Not Blaidd, it seemeth.
106170011	
106170012	
106170013	
106170014	
106170015	
106170016	
106170017	
106170018	
106170019	
106170020	Even in my slumber, I sensed it.
106170021	
106170022	
106170023	
106170024	
106170025	
106170026	
106170027	
106170028	
106170029	
106170030	It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?
106170031	
106170032	
106170033	
106170034	
106170035	
106170036	
106170037	
106170038	
106170039	
106170040	My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.
106170041	
106170042	
106170043	
106170044	
106170045	
106170046	
106170047	
106170048	
106170049	
106170050	Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
106171000	Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this.
106171001	
106171002	
106171003	
106171004	
106171005	
106171006	
106171007	
106171008	
106171009	
106171010	Take it.
106171011	
106171012	
106171013	
106171014	
106171015	
106171016	
106171017	
106171018	
106171019	
106171020	My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it.
106171021	
106171022	
106171023	
106171024	
106171025	
106171026	
106171027	
106171028	
106171029	
106171030	Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire.
106171031	
106171032	
106171033	
106171034	
106171035	
106171036	
106171037	
106171038	
106171039	
106171040	I can fathom what thy purpose might be.
106171041	
106171042	
106171043	
106171044	
106171045	
106171046	
106171047	
106171048	
106171049	
106171050	Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see.
106171051	
106171052	
106171053	
106171054	
106171055	
106171056	
106171057	
106171058	
106171059	
106171060	You may leave now.
106171061	
106171062	
106171063	
106171064	
106171065	
106171066	
106171067	
106171068	
106171069	
106171070	It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.
106172000	What is it?
106172001	
106172002	
106172003	
106172004	
106172005	
106172006	
106172007	
106172008	
106172009	
106172010	Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not?
106172011	
106172012	
106172013	
106172014	
106172015	
106172016	
106172017	
106172018	
106172019	
106172020	You may leave now.
106172021	
106172022	
106172023	
106172024	
106172025	
106172026	
106172027	
106172028	
106172029	
106172030	I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
106175000	Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.
106175001	
106175002	
106175003	
106175004	
106175005	
106175006	
106175007	
106175008	
106175009	
106175010	My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.
106175011	
106175012	
106175013	
106175014	
106175015	
106175016	
106175017	
106175018	
106175019	
106175020	A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.
106175021	
106175022	
106175023	
106175024	
106175025	
106175026	
106175027	
106175028	
106175029	
106175030	I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.
106175031	
106175032	
106175033	
106175034	
106175035	
106175036	
106175037	
106175038	
106175039	
106175040	I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter.
106175041	
106175042	
106175043	
106175044	
106175045	
106175046	
106175047	
106175048	
106175049	
106175050	I must thank Torrent too, for his part.
106175051	
106175052	
106175053	
106175054	
106175055	
106175056	
106175057	
106175058	
106175059	
106175060	You may leave now.
106175061	
106175062	
106175063	
106175064	
106175065	
106175066	
106175067	
106175068	
106175069	
106175070	It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.
106176000	What is it? You may go.
106176001	
106176002	
106176003	
106176004	
106176005	
106176006	
106176007	
106176008	
106176009	
106176010	I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
106190000	...
106191000	...
106192000	...
106192001	
106192002	
106192003	
106192004	
106192005	
106192006	
106192007	
106192008	
106192009	
106192010	Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?
106192011	
106192012	
106192013	
106192014	
106192015	
106192016	
106192017	
106192018	
106192019	
106192020	Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?
106192021	
106192022	
106192023	
106192024	
106192025	
106192026	
106192027	
106192028	
106192029	
106192030	Fine...fine.
106192031	
106192032	
106192033	
106192034	
106192035	
106192036	
106192037	
106192038	
106192039	
106192040	I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise.
106192041	
106192042	
106192043	
106192044	
106192045	
106192046	
106192047	
106192048	
106192049	
106192050	But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.
106192051	
106192052	
106192053	
106192054	
106192055	
106192056	
106192057	
106192058	
106192059	
106192060	Perform for me a service, as recompense.
106192061	
106192062	
106192063	
106192064	
106192065	
106192066	
106192067	
106192068	
106192069	
106192070	Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.
106192071	
106192072	
106192073	
106192074	
106192075	
106192076	
106192077	
106192078	
106192079	
106192080	The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
106192081	
106192082	
106192083	
106192084	
106192085	
106192086	
106192087	
106192088	
106192089	
106192090	I will not brook disobedience in this matter.
106193000	Perform for me a service, as recompense.
106193001	
106193002	
106193003	
106193004	
106193005	
106193006	
106193007	
106193008	
106193009	
106193010	Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.
106193011	
106193012	
106193013	
106193014	
106193015	
106193016	
106193017	
106193018	
106193019	
106193020	The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
106193021	
106193022	
106193023	
106193024	
106193025	
106193026	
106193027	
106193028	
106193029	
106193030	I will not brook disobedience in this matter.
106200000	Let us speak of the past, a while.
106200001	
106200002	
106200003	
106200004	
106200005	
106200006	
106200007	
106200008	
106200009	
106200010	I was once an Empyrean.
106200011	
106200012	
106200013	
106200014	
106200015	
106200016	
106200017	
106200018	
106200019	
106200020	Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.
106200021	
106200022	
106200023	
106200024	
106200025	
106200026	
106200027	
106200028	
106200029	
106200030	Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika,\nto become the new god of the coming age.
106200031	
106200032	
106200033	
106200034	
106200035	
106200036	
106200037	
106200038	
106200039	
106200040	Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.
106200041	
106200042	
106200043	
106200044	
106200045	
106200046	
106200047	
106200048	
106200049	
106200050	But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.
106200051	
106200052	
106200053	
106200054	
106200055	
106200056	
106200057	
106200058	
106200059	
106200060	I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.
106200061	
106200062	
106200063	
106200064	
106200065	
106200066	
106200067	
106200068	
106200069	
106200070	I would not be controlled by that thing.
106200071	
106200072	
106200073	
106200074	
106200075	
106200076	
106200077	
106200078	
106200079	
106200080	The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...
106200081	
106200082	
106200083	
106200084	
106200085	
106200086	
106200087	
106200088	
106200089	
106200090	And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
106201000	I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since.
106201001	
106201002	
106201003	
106201004	
106201005	
106201006	
106201007	
106201008	
106201009	
106201010	The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
106210000	Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.
106210001	
106210002	
106210003	
106210004	
106210005	
106210006	
106210007	
106210008	
106210009	
106210010	Blaidd remained my loyal ally.
106210011	
106210012	
106210013	
106210014	
106210015	
106210016	
106210017	
106210018	
106210019	
106210020	Heh.
106210021	
106210022	
106210023	
106210024	
106210025	
106210026	
106210027	
106210028	
106210029	
106210030	Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,
106210031	
106210032	
106210033	
106210034	
106210035	
106210036	
106210037	
106210038	
106210039	
106210040	He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.
106210041	
106210042	
106210043	
106210044	
106210045	
106210046	
106210047	
106210048	
106210049	
106210050	Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.
106210051	
106210052	
106210053	
106210054	
106210055	
106210056	
106210057	
106210058	
106210059	
106210060	Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...
106210061	
106210062	
106210063	
106210064	
106210065	
106210066	
106210067	
106210068	
106210069	
106210070	That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.
106210071	
106210072	
106210073	
106210074	
106210075	
106210076	
106210077	
106210078	
106210079	
106210080	Ah, should I add thee to the list?
106210081	
106210082	
106210083	
106210084	
106210085	
106210086	
106210087	
106210088	
106210089	
106210090	Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.
106211000	Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue.
106211001	
106211002	
106211003	
106211004	
106211005	
106211006	
106211007	
106211008	
106211009	
106211010	I've let slip too much.
106211011	
106211012	
106211013	
106211014	
106211015	
106211016	
106211017	
106211018	
106211019	
106211020	Forget what thou'st heard. Forget.
106220000	O Shadow, thou'rt the last.
106220001	
106220002	
106220003	
106220004	
106220005	
106220006	
106220007	
106220008	
106220009	
106220010	Tell the Two Fingers,
106220011	
106220012	
106220013	
106220014	
106220015	
106220016	
106220017	
106220018	
106220019	
106220020	That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh.
106220021	
106220022	
106220023	
106220024	
106220025	
106220026	
106220027	
106220028	
106220029	
106220030	With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal.
106230000	Beautifully fought.
106230001	
106230002	
106230003	
106230004	
106230005	
106230006	
106230007	
106230008	
106230009	
106230010	My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned.
106230011	
106230012	
106230013	
106230014	
106230015	
106230016	
106230017	
106230018	
106230019	
106230020	Now I can finally stand before them.
106230021	
106230022	
106230023	
106230024	
106230025	
106230026	
106230027	
106230028	
106230029	
106230030	This is farewell, my dear.
106230031	
106230032	
106230033	
106230034	
106230035	
106230036	
106230037	
106230038	
106230039	
106230040	Tell Blaidd, and Iji...
106230041	
106230042	
106230043	
106230044	
106230045	
106230046	
106230047	
106230048	
106230049	
106230050	I love them.
106240000	So, it was thee, who would become my Lord.
106240001	
106240002	
106240003	
106240004	
106240005	
106240006	
106240007	
106240008	
106240009	
106240010	Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.
106240011	
106240012	
106240013	
106240014	
106240015	
106240016	
106240017	
106240018	
106240019	
106240020	I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.
106240021	
106240022	
106240023	
106240024	
106240025	
106240026	
106240027	
106240028	
106240029	
106240030	I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.
106240031	
106240032	
106240033	
106240034	
106240035	
106240036	
106240037	
106240038	
106240039	
106240040	I bid thee travel the path of the Lord.
106240041	
106240042	
106240043	
106240044	
106240045	
106240046	
106240047	
106240048	
106240049	
106240050	And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.
106250000	...
106250001	
106250002	
106250003	
106250004	
106250005	
106250006	
106250007	
106250008	
106250009	
106250010	I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised.
106250011	
106250012	
106250013	
106250014	
106250015	
106250016	
106250017	
106250018	
106250019	
106250020	I thought I might expound a little further...
106250021	
106250022	
106250023	
106250024	
106250025	
106250026	
106250027	
106250028	
106250029	
106250030	Upon the order I envision.
106250031	
106250032	
106250033	
106250034	
106250035	
106250036	
106250037	
106250038	
106250039	
106250040	Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.
106250041	
106250042	
106250043	
106250044	
106250045	
106250046	
106250047	
106250048	
106250049	
106250050	I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.
106250051	
106250052	
106250053	
106250054	
106250055	
106250056	
106250057	
106250058	
106250059	
106250060	As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove.
106250061	
106250062	
106250063	
106250064	
106250065	
106250066	
106250067	
106250068	
106250069	
106250070	And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...
106250071	
106250072	
106250073	
106250074	
106250075	
106250076	
106250077	
106250078	
106250079	
106250080	All become impossibilities.
106250081	
106250082	
106250083	
106250084	
106250085	
106250086	
106250087	
106250088	
106250089	
106250090	Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.
106250091	
106250092	
106250093	
106250094	
106250095	
106250096	
106250097	
106250098	
106250099	
106250100	Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?
106251000	Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.
106251001	
106251002	
106251003	
106251004	
106251005	
106251006	
106251007	
106251008	
106251009	
106251010	And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order.
106251011	
106251012	
106251013	
106251014	
106251015	
106251016	
106251017	
106251018	
106251019	
106251020	Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?
106260000	Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening.
106260001	
106260002	
106260003	
106260004	
106260005	
106260006	
106260007	
106260008	
106260009	
106260010	The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.
106260011	
106260012	
106260013	
106260014	
106260015	
106260016	
106260017	
106260018	
106260019	
106260020	I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.
106260021	
106260022	
106260023	
106260024	
106260025	
106260026	
106260027	
106260028	
106260029	
106260030	Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand,
106260031	
106260032	
106260033	
106260034	
106260035	
106260036	
106260037	
106260038	
106260039	
106260040	Didst thou think to have thy way with me?
106260041	
106260042	
106260043	
106260044	
106260045	
106260046	
106260047	
106260048	
106260049	
106260050	Be gone. Hapless scum.
106260051	
106260052	
106260053	
106260054	
106260055	
106260056	
106260057	
106260058	
106260059	
106260060	I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.
106261000	I have spoken. Away from my sight.
106262000	This is the third time, fiend.
106262001	
106262002	
106262003	
106262004	
106262005	
106262006	
106262007	
106262008	
106262009	
106262010	Enough of thy unbearable breath.
106300000	What hopest thou to profit?
106300001	
106300002	
106300003	
106300004	
106300005	
106300006	
106300007	
106300008	
106300009	
106300010	...
106300011	
106300012	
106300013	
106300014	
106300015	
106300016	
106300017	
106300018	
106300019	
106300020	To think such was thy plot.
106300021	
106300022	
106300023	
106300024	
106300025	
106300026	
106300027	
106300028	
106300029	
106300030	Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies.
106300031	
106300032	
106300033	
106300034	
106300035	
106300036	
106300037	
106300038	
106300039	
106300040	I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.
106300041	
106300042	
106300043	
106300044	
106300045	
106300046	
106300047	
106300048	
106300049	
106300050	...
106301000	What hopest thou to profit?
106301001	
106301002	
106301003	
106301004	
106301005	
106301006	
106301007	
106301008	
106301009	
106301010	...
106301011	
106301012	
106301013	
106301014	
106301015	
106301016	
106301017	
106301018	
106301019	
106301020	Hmph.
106301021	
106301022	
106301023	
106301024	
106301025	
106301026	
106301027	
106301028	
106301029	
106301030	So, this is the measure of my Lord?
106301031	
106301032	
106301033	
106301034	
106301035	
106301036	
106301037	
106301038	
106301039	
106301040	Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve.
106301041	
106301042	
106301043	
106301044	
106301045	
106301046	
106301047	
106301048	
106301049	
106301050	…For surrendering myself to delusion.
106301051	
106301052	
106301053	
106301054	
106301055	
106301056	
106301057

112003000	...
112004000	...
112005000	...
112010000	...
112011000	...!
200001000	Come, sweetings, become what ye desire.
200001900	Come, sweetings, time to be born, anew.
200002000	Be not afeard, little culver.
200002900	Hush, little culver.
200002901	Hush, fair maid.
200002902	
200002903	
200002904	
200002905	
200002906	
200002907	
200002908	
200002909	
200002910	I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...
200003000	 
200003100	 
200004000	Come, Oath-sworn giant!
200004001	
200004002	
200004003	
200004004	
200004005	
200004006	
200004007	
200004008	
200004009	
200004010	Come, Oath-sworn dragon!

200004014	
200004015

200004017	
200004018	
200004019	
200004020	Come, Oath-sworn beasts!

200004023	
200004024	
200004025	
200004026	
200004027	
200004028	
200004029	
200004030	Come, Blaidd, my child!
200005000	Fair child, Hermes!
200006000	Thy fate lieth under my moon.
200007000	Guide thy moon as thou wishest.
200007001	
200007002	
200007003	
200007004	
200007005	
200007006	
200007007	
200007008	
200007009	
200007010	Ranni, my little baby...
200007011	
200007012	
200007013	
200007014	
200007015	
200007016	
200007017	
200007018	
200007019	
200007020	I thank thee...
200007900	Oh little Ranni, my dear daughter.
200007901	
200007902	
200007903	
200007904	
200007905	
200007906	
200007907	
200007908	
200007909	
200007910	Weave thy night into being...
200008000	 
200008100	 
200009000	Where did ye flee, my sweetings?
200009001	
200009002	
200009003	
200009004	
200009005	
200009006	
200009007	
200009008	
200009009	
200009010	Come out, from whence ye hide. There are books and light aplenty.
200009011	
200009012	
200009013	
200009014	
200009015

200009017	
200009018	
200009019	
200009020	Dither not; come out say I!
200009021

200009023	
200009024

201001000	<giggling>
201002000	Who's that? Who could it be?
201002050	A new child, Mother's newborn.
201002100	A new friend. A new playmate for us.
201002150	Just watch, he'll be born again.
201002151	Just watch, she'll be born again.
201002200	Then Mother will hold him tight.
201002201	Then Mother will hold her tight.
201002250	He'll be so warm, warm and cosy.
201002251	She'll be so warm, warm and cosy.
201002300	That'd be nice, so very nice.
201002350	If we're turned to stone, will we be born again?
201002400	Will Mother hold us again?
201002450	Will we? Will she?
201002500	<giggling>
201002550	<giggling>
201003000	That hurts. Please, stop that.
201003050	Did he just die? And him, too?
201003100	Is he not a friend? I can't tell…
201003101	Is she not a friend? I can't tell…
201003150	Maybe he's something else?
201003151	Maybe she's something else?
201003200	Can we still be friends, if we try?
201003250	Yes, we can be friends, I'm sure.
201003300	He'll understand, if we just explain.
201003301	She'll understand, if we just explain.

213003003	
213003004	
213003005	
213003006	
213003007	
213003008	
213003009	
213003010	
213010000	Well, where've you been hiding?
213010001	
213010002	
213010003	
213010004	
213010005	
213010006	
213010007	
213010008	
213010009	
213010010	I took you for dead.
213010011	
213010012	
213010013	
213010014	
213010015	
213010016	
213010017	
213010018	
213010019	
213010020	No matter. It's all the same.
213010021	
213010022	
213010023	
213010024	
213010025	
213010026	
213010027	
213010028	
213010029	
213010030	Lay out your arms, then.
213020000	I see you've noticed the chains.
213020001	
213020002	
213020003	
213020004	
213020005	
213020006	
213020007	
213020008	
213020009	
213020010	Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.
213020011	
213020012	
213020013	
213020014	
213020015	
213020016	
213020017	
213020018	
213020019	
213020020	I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools.
213020021	
213020022	
213020023	
213020024	
213020025	
213020026	
213020027	
213020028	
213020029	
213020030	That's all there is to it.
213021000	Nah, don't read too much into it.
213021001	
213021002	
213021003	
213021004	
213021005	
213021006	
213021007	
213021008	
213021009	
213021010	I've no grudge against you.
213021011	
213021012	
213021013	
213021014	
213021015	
213021016	
213021017	
213021018	
213021019	
213021020	My being a prisoner is no fault of yours.
213021021	
213021022	
213021023	
213021024	
213021025	
213021026	
213021027	
213021028	
213021029	
213021030	Besides, I don't mind smithing.
213021031	
213021032	
213021033	
213021034	
213021035	
213021036	
213021037	
213021038	
213021039	
213021040	Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails.
213021041	
213021042	
213021043	
213021044	
213021045	
213021046	
213021047	
213021048	
213021049	
213021050	Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her...
213022000	Like the look of that whetstone knife, do you?
213022001	
213022002	
213022003	
213022004	
213022005	
213022006	
213022007	
213022008	
213022009	
213022010	I've no need for it.
213022011	
213022012	
213022013	
213022014	
213022015	
213022016	
213022017	
213022018	
213022019	
213022020	You're welcome to take it. Go ahead.
213030000	Now, look at you.
213030001	
213030002	
213030003	
213030004	
213030005	
213030006	
213030007	
213030008	
213030009	
213030010	Those eyes tell a story.
213030011	
213030012	
213030013	
213030014	
213030015	
213030016	
213030017	
213030018	
213030019	
213030020	Of a challenger, who's felled his mark.
213030021	Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.
213030022	
213030023	
213030024	
213030025	
213030026	
213030027	
213030028	
213030029	
213030030	Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms.
213040000	Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness.
213040001	
213040002	
213040003	
213040004	
213040005	
213040006	
213040007	
213040008	
213040009	
213040010	The road is yet long. A god is not easily felled.
213040011	
213040012	
213040013	
213040014	
213040015	
213040016	
213040017	
213040018	
213040019	
213040020	But one day, without fail, you will have your wish.
213040021	
213040022	
213040023	
213040024	
213040025	
213040026	
213040027	
213040028	
213040029	
213040030	So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...
213041000	Those words were not meant for you.
213041001	
213041002	
213041003	
213041004	
213041005	
213041006	
213041007	
213041008	
213041009	
213041010	I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.
213041011	
213041012	
213041013	
213041014	
213041015	
213041016	
213041017	
213041018	
213041019	
213041020	But my prayers are mine and mine alone.
213041021	
213041022	
213041023	
213041024	
213041025	
213041026	
213041027	
213041028	
213041029	
213041030	Good. I'll be more careful too.
213041031	
213041032	
213041033	
213041034	
213041035	
213041036	
213041037	
213041038	
213041039	
213041040	Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.
213042000	Ah. You, is it?
213042001	
213042002	
213042003	
213042004	
213042005	
213042006	
213042007	
213042008	
213042009	
213042010	I...didn't notice you there.
213042011	
213042012	
213042013	
213042014	
213042015	
213042016	
213042017	
213042018	
213042019	
213042020	I'll be doing my job, same as ever.
213042021	
213042022	
213042023	
213042024	
213042025	
213042026	
213042027	
213042028	
213042029	
213042030	Just lay out your arms.
213050000	The girl you brought here...
213050001	
213050002	
213050003	
213050004	
213050005	
213050006	
213050007	
213050008	
213050009	
213050010	She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade,
213050011	
213050012	
213050013	
213050014	
213050015	
213050016	
213050017	
213050018	
213050019	
213050020	but she has a gift for spirit tuning.
213050021	
213050022	
213050023	
213050024	
213050025	
213050026	
213050027	
213050028	
213050029	
213050030	I saw another one like her, long ago.
213050031	
213050032	
213050033	
213050034	
213050035	
213050036	
213050037	
213050038	
213050039	
213050040	Their eyes share the same hue.
213051000	The girl? What about her?
213052000	Are you out of your mind?
213052001	
213052002	
213052003	
213052004	
213052005	
213052006	
213052007	
213052008	
213052009	
213052010	Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?
213052011	
213052012	
213052013	
213052014	
213052015	
213052016	
213052017	
213052018	
213052019	
213052020	Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it.
213053000	I refuse to believe it.
213053001	
213053002	
213053003	
213053004	
213053005	
213053006	
213053007	
213053008	
213053009	
213053010	I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true.
213060000	I spoke with the girl.
213060001	
213060002	
213060003	
213060004	
213060005	
213060006	
213060007	
213060008	
213060009	
213060010	She has a gift for spirit tuning.
213060011	
213060012	
213060013	
213060014	
213060015	
213060016	
213060017	
213060018	
213060019	
213060020	So I told her everything I know.
213060021	
213060022	
213060023	
213060024	
213060025	
213060026	
213060027	
213060028	
213060029	
213060030	I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago.
213060031	
213060032	
213060033	
213060034	
213060035	
213060036	
213060037	
213060038	
213060039	
213060040	It was all I could do to honour her.
213060041	
213060042	
213060043	
213060044	
213060045	
213060046	
213060047	
213060048	
213060049	
213060050	I'm sorry I doubted you.
213070000	The girl has come a long way.
213070001	
213070002	
213070003	
213070004	
213070005	
213070006	
213070007	
213070008	
213070009	
213070010	As ever, time and technique have made her stronger.
213070011	
213070012	
213070013	
213070014	
213070015	
213070016	
213070017	
213070018	
213070019	
213070020	Tis good to see.
213070021	
213070022	
213070023	
213070024	
213070025	
213070026	
213070027	
213070028	
213070029	
213070030	An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.
213070031	
213070032	
213070033	
213070034	
213070035	
213070036	
213070037	
213070038	
213070039	
213070040	But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.
213070041	
213070042	
213070043	
213070044	
213070045	
213070046	
213070047	
213070048	
213070049	
213070050	I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.
213080000	No, no, no, no...
213080001	
213080002	
213080003	
213080004	
213080005	
213080006	
213080007	
213080008	
213080009	
213080010	I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.
213080011	
213080012	
213080013	
213080014	
213080015	
213080016	
213080017	
213080018	
213080019	
213080020	I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!
213081000	Oh, it's you.
213081001	
213081002	
213081003	
213081004	
213081005	
213081006	
213081007	
213081008	
213081009	
213081010	Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.
213081011	
213081012	
213081013	
213081014	
213081015	
213081016	
213081017	
213081018	
213081019	
213081020	Just lay out your arms.
213090000	Are you having second thoughts?
213090001	
213090002	
213090003	
213090004	
213090005	
213090006	
213090007	
213090008	
213090009	
213090010	Might I have a word, then?
213090011	
213090012	
213090013	
213090014	
213090015	
213090016	
213090017	
213090018	
213090019	
213090020	Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.
213090021	
213090022	
213090023	
213090024	
213090025	
213090026	
213090027	
213090028	
213090029	
213090030	The demigods. And their god.
213090031	
213090032	
213090033	
213090034	
213090035	
213090036	
213090037	
213090038	
213090039	
213090040	If you remain loyal to your calling,
213090041	
213090042	
213090043	
213090044	
213090045	
213090046	
213090047	
213090048	
213090049	
213090050	then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,
213090051	
213090052	
213090053	
213090054	
213090055	
213090056	
213090057	
213090058	
213090059	
213090060	I will never cease to smith your weapons.
213090061	
213090062	
213090063	
213090064	
213090065	
213090066	
213090067	
213090068	
213090069	
213090070	Until you have one to slay a god.
213100000	I knew you'd be back.
213100001	
213100002

213100004	
213100005	
213100006	
213100007	
213100008	
213100009	
213100010	Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.
213101000	Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.
213110000	Weren't you listening?
213110001	
213110002	
213110003	
213110004	
213110005	
213110006	
213110007	
213110008	
213110009	
213110010	As I've always said.
213110011	
213110012	
213110013	
213110014	
213110015	
213110016	
213110017	
213110018	
213110019	
213110020	You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.
213110021	
213110022	
213110023	
213110024	
213110025	
213110026	
213110027	
213110028	
213110029	
213110030	And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.
213110031	
213110032	
213110033	
213110034	
213110035	
213110036	
213110037	
213110038	
213110039	
213110040	It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.
213111000	I've upset the girl.
213111001	
213111002	
213111003	
213111004	
213111005	
213111006	
213111007	
213111008	
213111009	
213111010	She says that now that my chains are broken, I'm free.
213111011	
213111012	
213111013	
213111014	
213111015	
213111016	
213111017	
213111018	
213111019	
213111020	That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.
213111021	
213111022	
213111023	
213111024	
213111025	
213111026	
213111027	
213111028	
213111029	
213111030	 
213111031	
213111032	
213111033	
213111034	
213111035	
213111036	
213111037	
213111038	
213111039	
213111040	What use have I for freedom now?
213111041	
213111042	
213111043	
213111044	
213111045	
213111046	
213111047	
213111048	
213111049	
213111050	I smith weapons to slay a god.
213111051	
213111052	
213111053	
213111054	
213111055	
213111056	
213111057	
213111058	
213111059	
213111060	I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.
213111061	
213111062	
213111063	
213111064	
213111065	
213111066	
213111067	
213111068	
213111069	
213111070	Is there any other way?
213120000	Oh, finally! It's complete!
213120001	
213120002	
213120003	
213120004	
213120005	
213120006	
213120007	
213120008	
213120009	
213120010	I've done it! A weapon to slay a god!
213120011	
213120012	
213120013	
213120014	
213120015	
213120016	
213120017	
213120018	
213120019	
213120020	Oh, you have my deepest gratitude.
213120021	
213120022	
213120023	
213120024	
213120025	
213120026	
213120027	
213120028	
213120029	
213120030	Thanks to you, my wish is granted.
213120031	
213120032	
213120033	
213120034	
213120035	
213120036	
213120037	
213120038	
213120039	
213120040	Now wield it, and kill them.
213120041	
213120042	
213120043	
213120044	
213120045	
213120046	
213120047	
213120048	
213120049	
213120050	The demigods. And their god.
213120051	
213120052	
213120053	
213120054	
213120055	
213120056	
213120057	
213120058	
213120059	
213120060	Queen Marika herself wishes it so.
213121000	You seek better weapons still?
213121001	
213121002	
213121003	
213121004	
213121005	
213121006	
213121007	
213121008	
213121009	
213121010	Very well. I'll smith another, if needed.
213121011	
213121012	
213121013	
213121014	
213121015	
213121016	
213121017	
213121018	
213121019	
213121020	A weapon to slay a god.
213122000	I'll smith as long as you like.
213122001	
213122002	
213122003	
213122004	
213122005	
213122006	
213122007	
213122008	
213122009	
213122010	Now, lay out your arms.
213123000	I'll smith...as long as you like.
213123001	
213123002	
213123003	
213123004	
213123005	
213123006	
213123007	
213123008	
213123009	
213123010	Now...lay out your...arms.
213124000	I'll smith...as long...as you like.
213124001	
213124002	
213124003	
213124004	
213124005	
213124006	
213124007	
213124008	
213124009	
213124010	Now...lay out...your...arms.
213130000	Use my masterpiece to slay a god.
213130001	
213130002	
213130003	
213130004	
213130005	
213130006	
213130007	
213130008	
213130009	
213130010	That is all that I have lived for.
213130011	
213130012	
213130013	
213130014	
213130015	
213130016	
213130017	
213130018	
213130019	
213130020	And my promise to Q-queen Marika.
213130021	
213130022	
213130023	
213130024	
213130025	
213130026	
213130027	
213130028	
213130029	
213130030	But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.
213131000	I can't hold on much longer.
213131001	
213131002	
213131003	
213131004	
213131005	
213131006	
213131007	
213131008	
213131009	
213131010	I'm going the way of the R-roundtable...
213131011	
213131012	
213131013	
213131014	
213131015	
213131016	
213131017	
213131018	
213131019	
213131020	It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.
213131021	
213131022	
213131023	
213131024	
213131025	
213131026	
213131027	
213131028	
213131029	
213131030	Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends.
213131031	
213131032	
213131033	
213131034	
213131035	
213131036	
213131037	
213131038	
213131039	
213131040	My lord, f-for that is what you are.
213140000	Who are you?
213140001	
213140002	
213140003	
213140004	
213140005	
213140006	
213140007	
213140008	
213140009	
213140010	Oh, I must be a blacksmith.
213140011	
213140012	
213140013	
213140014	
213140015	
213140016	
213140017	
213140018	
213140019	
213140020	Now, let's get smithing...
213141000	Could you tell me what happened?
213141001	
213141002	
213141003	
213141004	
213141005	
213141006	
213141007	
213141008	
213141009	
213141010	Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?
213141011	
213141012	
213141013	
213141014	
213141015	
213141016	
213141017	
213141018	
213141019	
213141020	Why does that girl weep for me?
213141021	
213141022	
213141023	
213141024	
213141025	
213141026	
213141027	
213141028	
213141029	
213141030	Have I forgotten something of dire importance?
213150000	Now, let's get smithing...
213160000	...
213160001	
213160002	
213160003	
213160004	
213160005	
213160006	
213160007	
213160008	
213160009	
213160010	I-I smith... I do...
213170000	
213170001	
213170002	
213170003	
213170004	
213170005	
213170006	
213170007	
213170008	
213170009	
213170010	
213170011	
213170012	
213170013	
213170014	
213170015	
213170016	
213170017	
213170018	
213170019	
213170020	
213170021	
213170022	
213170023	
213170024	
213170025	
213170026	
213170027	
213170028	
213170029	
213170030	
213171000	<sleeping>
214900000	A fine sacrifice indeed.
214900001	
214900002	
214900003	
214900004	
214900005	
214900006	
214900007	
214900008	
214900009	
214900010	Let us devour the gods, together!
214900900	Now you are family.
214901000	Now, we can devour the gods, together!
214902000	O shapers of gods, meddlers in fortune.
214902001	
214902002	
214902003	
214902004	
214902005	
214902006	
214902007	
214902008	
214902009	
214902010	I do not abide! By your suffocating Order.
214903000	 
214903100	 
214903200	 
214904000	So must it be.
214904001	
214904002	
214904003	
214904004	
214904005	
214904006	
214904007	
214904008	
214904009	
214904010	Eveligne, show him the way...
214904011	Eveligne, show her the way...
214904012	
214904013	
214904014	
214904015	
214904016	
214904017	
214904018	
214904019	
214904020	...to devour the gods.
214905000	No one will hold me captive.
214905001	
214905002	
214905003	
214905004	
214905005	
214905006	
214905007	
214905008	
214905009	
214905010	A serpent never dies.
214905011	
214905012	
214905013	
214905014	
214905015	
214905016	
214905017	
214905018	
214905019	
214905020	Ha ha ha...
216001000	<howl>
216002000	Who goes there?
216002001	
216002002	
216002003	
216002004	
216002005	
216002006	
216002007	
216002008	
216002009	
216002010	Kalé send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody.
216002011	
216002012	
216002013	
216002014	
216002015	
216002016	
216002017	
216002018	
216002019	
216002020	Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange.
216002021	
216002022	
216002023	
216002024	
216002025	
216002026	
216002027	
216002028	
216002029	
216002030	The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil".
216002031	
216002032	
216002033	
216002034	
216002035	
216002036	
216002037	
216002038	
216002039	
216002040	He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard.
216002041	
216002042	
216002043	
216002044	
216002045	
216002046	
216002047	
216002048	
216002049	
216002050	Come tell me if you find him before I do.
216002051	
216002052	
216002053	
216002054	
216002055	
216002056	
216002057	
216002058	
216002059	
216002060	I can offer you ample reward.
216003000	Darriwil is nothing but a traitor.
216003001	
216003002	
216003003	
216003004	
216003005	
216003006	
216003007	
216003008	
216003009	
216003010	And in need of a fitting end to his tale.
216010000	Darriwil...
216010001	
216010002	
216010003	
216010004	
216010005	
216010006	
216010007	
216010008	
216010009	
216010010	Rotting in a cell is no true justice.
216010011	
216010012	
216010013	
216010014	
216010015	
216010016	
216010017	
216010018	
216010019	
216010020	No, this is where it ends for you.
216020000	...Right. There you are.
216020001	
216020002	
216020003	
216020004	
216020005	
216020006	
216020007	
216020008	
216020009	
216020010	Had to work for it, but it's done.
216020011	
216020012	
216020013	
216020014	
216020015	
216020016	
216020017	
216020018	
216020019	
216020020	Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize.
216021000	Oh yes, I should say,
216021001	
216021002	
216021003	
216021004	
216021005	
216021006	
216021007	
216021008	
216021009	
216021010	If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side...
216021011	
216021012	
216021013	
216021014	
216021015	
216021016	
216021017	
216021018	
216021019	
216021020	Tell him I sent you.
216021021	
216021022	
216021023	
216021024	
216021025	
216021026	
216021027	
216021028	
216021029	
216021030	And he'll be sure to treat you right.
216021031	
216021032	
216021033	
216021034	
216021035	
216021036	
216021037	
216021038	
216021039	
216021040	I owe you one, I reckon.
216022000	That's enough chit-chat for now.
216022001	
216022002	
216022003	
216022004	
216022005	
216022006	
216022007	
216022008	
216022009	
216022010	It's time we parted ways.
216030000	Ahh, long time, friend.
216030001	
216030002	
216030003	
216030004	
216030005	
216030006	
216030007	
216030008	
216030009	
216030010	Blaidd, if you've forgotten.
216030011	
216030012	
216030013	
216030014	
216030015	
216030016	
216030017	
216030018	
216030019	
216030020	Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni.
216030021	
216030022	
216030023	
216030024	
216030025	
216030026	
216030027	
216030028	
216030029	
216030030	Well. Getting right to business...
216030031	
216030032	
216030033	
216030034	
216030035	
216030036	
216030037	
216030038	
216030039	
216030040	I'm still in Limgrave.
216030041	
216030042	
216030043	
216030044	
216030045	
216030046	
216030047	
216030048	
216030049	
216030050	The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.
216030051	
216030052	
216030053	
216030054	
216030055	
216030056	
216030057	
216030058	
216030059	
216030060	I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.
216030061	
216030062	
216030063	
216030064	
216030065	
216030066	
216030067	
216030068	
216030069	
216030070	See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...
216030071	
216030072	
216030073	
216030074	
216030075	
216030076	
216030077	
216030078	
216030079	
216030080	See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...
216031000	Ah. I heard about you. Good to finally meet.
216031001	
216031002	
216031003	
216031004	
216031005	
216031006	
216031007	
216031008	
216031009	
216031010	Name's Blaidd, sworn sword to mistress Ranni.
216031011	
216031012	
216031013	
216031014	
216031015	
216031016	
216031017	
216031018	
216031019	
216031020	Glad to have you aboard.
216031021	
216031022	
216031023	
216031024	
216031025	
216031026	
216031027	
216031028	
216031029	
216031030	Well. Getting right to business...
216031031	
216031032	
216031033	
216031034	
216031035	
216031036	
216031037	
216031038	
216031039	
216031040	I'm situated in Limgrave right now.
216031041	
216031042	
216031043	
216031044	
216031045	
216031046	
216031047	
216031048	
216031049	
216031050	The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.
216031051	
216031052	
216031053	
216031054	
216031055	
216031056	
216031057	
216031058	
216031059	
216031060	I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.
216031061	
216031062	
216031063	
216031064	
216031065	
216031066	
216031067	
216031068	
216031069	
216031070	See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...
216032000	I'm going below through the well in the Mistwood.
216032001	
216032002	
216032003	
216032004	
216032005	
216032006	
216032007	
216032008	
216032009	
216032010	See if I can't find the road to Nokron...
216032011	
216032012	
216032013	
216032014	
216032015	
216032016	
216032017	
216032018	
216032019	
216032020	Don't keep me waiting, eh.
216040000	Ah, good to see you.
216040001	
216040002	
216040003	
216040004	
216040005	
216040006	
216040007	
216040008	
216040009	
216040010	Apologies mate, but I don't have much to report.
216040011	
216040012	
216040013	
216040014	
216040015	
216040016	
216040017	
216040018	
216040019	
216040020	I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I'm absolutely stumped.
216040021	
216040022	
216040023	
216040024	
216040025	
216040026	
216040027	
216040028	
216040029	
216040030	I've tried all the gateways, to no avail...
216040031	
216040032	
216040033	
216040034	
216040035	
216040036	
216040037	
216040038	
216040039	
216040040	...Perhaps it's time to ask Seluvis?
216040041	
216040042	
216040043	
216040044	
216040045	
216040046	
216040047	
216040048	
216040049	
216040050	I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something...
216040051	
216040052	
216040053	
216040054	
216040055	
216040056	
216040057	
216040058	
216040059	
216040060	Let's give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are...
216041000	I jest, I wouldn't go that far.
216041001	
216041002	
216041003	
216041004	
216041005	
216041006	
216041007	
216041008	
216041009	
216041010	Besides, I should check on some things here.
216041011	
216041012	
216041013	
216041014	
216041015	
216041016	
216041017	
216041018	
216041019	
216041020	Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
216041021	
216041022	
216041023	
216041024	
216041025	
216041026	
216041027	
216041028	
216041029	
216041030	If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
216042000	Ah. Well met.
216042001	
216042002	
216042003	
216042004	
216042005	
216042006	
216042007	
216042008	
216042009	
216042010	What news?
216043000	Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
216043001	
216043002	
216043003	
216043004	
216043005	
216043006	
216043007	
216043008	
216043009	
216043010	If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
216043011	
216043012	
216043013	
216043014	
216043015	
216043016	
216043017	
216043018	
216043019	
216043020	And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.
216043021	
216043022	
216043023	
216043024	
216043025	
216043026	
216043027	
216043028	
216043029	
216043030	Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.
216050000	Hmm...
216050001	
216050002	
216050003	
216050004	
216050005	
216050006	
216050007	
216050008	
216050009	
216050010	So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...
216050011	
216050012	
216050013	
216050014	
216050015	
216050016	
216050017	
216050018	
216050019	
216050020	That reminds me of something I heard.
216050021	
216050022	
216050023	
216050024	
216050025	
216050026	
216050027	
216050028	
216050029	
216050030	There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave.
216050031	
216050032	
216050033	
216050034	
216050035	
216050036	
216050037	
216050038	
216050039	
216050040	It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself.\nHe who was once called the strongest of all the demigods...
216050041	
216050042	
216050043	
216050044	
216050045	
216050046	
216050047	
216050048	
216050049	
216050050	Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating.
216050051	
216050052	
216050053	
216050054	
216050055	
216050056	
216050057	
216050058	
216050059	
216050060	I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...
216051000	You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities...
216051001	
216051002	
216051003	
216051004	
216051005	
216051006	
216051007	
216051008	
216051009	
216051010	I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.
216051011	
216051012	
216051013	
216051014	
216051015	
216051016	
216051017	
216051018	
216051019	
216051020	The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.
216052000	Right. I see.
216052001	
216052002	
216052003	
216052004	
216052005	
216052006	
216052007	
216052008	
216052009	
216052010	Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
216052011	
216052012	
216052013	
216052014	
216052015	
216052016	
216052017	
216052018	
216052019	
216052020	If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
216053000	Hmm...
216053001	
216053002	
216053003	
216053004	
216053005	
216053006	
216053007	
216053008	
216053009	
216053010	So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...
216053011	
216053012	
216053013	
216053014	
216053015	
216053016	
216053017	
216053018	
216053019	
216053020	And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid,
216053021	
216053022	
216053023	
216053024	
216053025	
216053026	
216053027	
216053028	
216053029	
216053030	where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods.
216053031	
216053032	
216053033	
216053034	
216053035	
216053036	
216053037	
216053038	
216053039	
216053040	It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something.
216053041	
216053042	
216053043	
216053044	
216053045	
216053046	
216053047	
216053048	
216053049	
216053050	I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...
216060000	Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time.
216060020	The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain...
216060021	
216060022	
216060023	
216060024	
216060025	
216060026	
216060027	
216060028	
216060029	
216060030	Let's give them a show to remember, eh.
216060031	
216060032	
216060033	
216060034	
216060035	
216060036	
216060037	
216060038	
216060039	
216060040	Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too.
216061000	Once more into the fray together, eh.
216061001	
216061002	
216061003	
216061004	
216061005	
216061006	
216061007	
216061008	
216061009	
216061010	Heh. This might even be fun.
216062000	Into the fray together, eh.
216062001	
216062002	
216062003	
216062004	
216062005	
216062006	
216062007	
216062008	
216062009	
216062010	Heh. Let's see what you're made of.
216063000	Ah, thought I might find you here.
216063001	
216063002	
216063003	
216063004	
216063005	
216063006	
216063007	
216063008	
216063009	
216063010	I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting.
216063011	
216063012	
216063013	
216063014	
216063015	
216063016	
216063017	
216063018	
216063019	
216063020	But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh.
216063021	
216063022	
216063023	
216063024	
216063025	
216063026	
216063027	
216063028	
216063029	
216063030	You must have heard by now, right?
216063031	
216063032	
216063033	
216063034	
216063035	
216063036	
216063037	
216063038	
216063039	
216063040	That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis.
216063041	
216063042	
216063043	
216063044	
216063045	
216063046	
216063047	
216063048	
216063049	
216063050	But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion.
216063051	
216063052	
216063053	
216063054	
216063055	
216063056	
216063057	
216063058	
216063059	
216063060	So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all.
216063061	
216063062	
216063063	
216063064	
216063065	
216063066	
216063067	
216063068	
216063069	
216063070	The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.
216064000	Hm. Long time.
216064001	
216064002	
216064003	
216064004	
216064005	
216064006	
216064007	
216064008	
216064009	
216064010	Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths.
216064011	
216064012	
216064013	
216064014	
216064015	
216064016	
216064017	
216064018	
216064019	
216064020	Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.
216064021	
216064022	
216064023	
216064024	
216064025	
216064026	
216064027	
216064028	
216064029	
216064030	The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang.
216065000	Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself.
216065001	
216065002	
216065003	
216065004	
216065005	
216065006	
216065007	
216065008	
216065009	
216065010	Blaidd, warrior.
216065011	
216065012	
216065013	
216065014	
216065015	
216065016	
216065017	
216065018	
216065019	
216065020	Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.
216065021	
216065022	
216065023	
216065024	
216065025	
216065026	
216065027	
216065028	
216065029	
216065030	The way ahead is pleasingly simple; a path forged by sword and fang.
216066000	Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins.
216080000	Ah, good. I was waiting for you.
216080001	
216080002	
216080003	
216080004	
216080005	
216080006	
216080007	
216080008	
216080009	
216080010	What a sick way to fight, eh.
216080011	
216080012	
216080013	
216080014	
216080015	
216080016	
216080017	
216080018	
216080019	
216080020	The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.
216080021	
216080022	
216080023	
216080024	
216080025	
216080026	
216080027	
216080028	
216080029	
216080030	And hah! Did you see that, afterwards?
216080031	
216080032	
216080033	
216080034	
216080035	
216080036	
216080037	
216080038	
216080039	
216080040	A falling star, right before our eyes!
216080041	
216080042	
216080043	
216080044	
216080045	
216080046	
216080047	
216080048	
216080049	
216080050	I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.
216080051	
216080052	
216080053	
216080054	
216080055	
216080056	
216080057	
216080058	
216080059	
216080060	He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.
216080061	
216080062	
216080063	
216080064	
216080065	
216080066	
216080067	
216080068	
216080069	
216080070	And, the path has now been cleared.
216080071	
216080072	
216080073	
216080074	
216080075	
216080076	
216080077	
216080078	
216080079	
216080080	To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided.
216080081	
216080082	
216080083	
216080084	
216080085	
216080086	
216080087	
216080088	
216080089	
216080090	Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.
216080091	
216080092	
216080093	
216080094	
216080095	
216080096	
216080097	
216080098	
216080099	
216080100	We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni.
216081000	Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.
216081001	
216081002	
216081003	
216081004	
216081005	
216081006	
216081007	
216081008	
216081009	
216081010	And we'll go into battle again, side by side.
216081011	
216081012	
216081013	
216081014	
216081015	
216081016	
216081017	
216081018	
216081019	
216081020	My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang.
216081021	
216081022	
216081023	
216081024	
216081025	
216081026	
216081027	
216081028	
216081029	
216081030	The curtain's rising...on the final act.
216082000	Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate.
216082001	
216082002	
216082003	
216082004	
216082005	
216082006	
216082007	
216082008	
216082009	
216082010	The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.
216082011	
216082012	
216082013	
216082014	
216082015	
216082016	
216082017	
216082018	
216082019	
216082020	And then a falling star, right before our eyes!
216082021	
216082022	
216082023	
216082024	
216082025	
216082026	
216082027	
216082028	
216082029	
216082030	I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.
216082031	
216082032	
216082033	
216082034	
216082035	
216082036	
216082037	
216082038	
216082039	
216082040	He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.
216083000	Well, it's time I left.
216083001	
216083002	
216083003	
216083004	
216083005	
216083006	
216083007	
216083008	
216083009	
216083010	The wheel of fate has been set into motion.
216083011	
216083012	
216083013	
216083014	
216083015	
216083016	
216083017	
216083018	
216083019	
216083020	If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.
216083021	
216083022	
216083023	
216083024	
216083025	
216083026	
216083027	
216083028	
216083029	
216083030	You are a fine warrior.
216084000	If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.
216084001	
216084002	
216084003	
216084004	
216084005	
216084006	
216084007	
216084008	
216084009	
216084010	You are a fine warrior.
216090000	<howl>
216100000	Oh, it's you...
216100001	
216100002	
216100003	
216100004	
216100005	
216100006	
216100007	
216100008	
216100009	
216100010	It's me, Blaidd.
216100011	
216100012	
216100013	
216100014	
216100015	
216100016	
216100017	
216100018	
216100019	
216100020	Old Iji trapped me here.
216100021	
216100022	
216100023	
216100024	
216100025	
216100026	
216100027	
216100028	
216100029	
216100030	Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni.
216100031	
216100032	
216100033	
216100034	
216100035	
216100036	
216100037	
216100038	
216100039	
216100040	But there's no chance that could happen.
216100041	
216100042	
216100043	
216100044	
216100045	
216100046	
216100047	
216100048	
216100049	
216100050	I'm part of her being. Her very shadow...
216100051	
216100052	
216100053	
216100054	
216100055	
216100056	
216100057	
216100058	
216100059	
216100060	I thought old Iji knew as much...
216100061	
216100062	
216100063	
216100064	
216100065	
216100066	
216100067	
216100068	
216100069	
216100070	Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...
216101000	I don't understand. Why would Iji do this...
216101001	
216101002	
216101003	
216101004	
216101005	
216101006	
216101007	
216101008	
216101009	
216101010	I could never intend harm to Lady Ranni. What's he thinking...
216110000	My thanks, friend.
216110001	
216110002	
216110003	
216110004	
216110005	
216110006	
216110007	
216110008	
216110009	
216110010	I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.
216110011	
216110012	
216110013	
216110014	
216110015	
216110016	
216110017	
216110018	
216110019	
216110020	I don't know what came over old Iji,
216110021	
216110022	
216110023	
216110024	
216110025	
216110026	
216110027	
216110028	
216110029	
216110030	but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.
216110031	
216110032	
216110033	
216110034	
216110035	
216110036	
216110037	
216110038	
216110039	
216110040	Now, Ranni can finally set in motion
216110041	
216110042	
216110043	
216110044	
216110045	
216110046	
216110047	
216110048	
216110049	
216110050	the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.
216111000	I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.
216111001	
216111002	
216111003	
216111004	
216111005	
216111006	
216111007	
216111008	
216111009	
216111010	I don't know what came over old Iji,
216111011	
216111012	
216111013	
216111014	
216111015	
216111016	
216111017	
216111018	
216111019	
216111020	but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.
216120000	...
216120001	
216120002	
216120003	
216120004	
216120005	
216120006	
216120007	
216120008	
216120009	
216120010	No. I'm part of her very being!
216120011	
216120012	
216120013	
216120014	
216120015	
216120016	
216120017	
216120018	
216120019	
216120020	I could never betray her!
216120021	
216120022	
216120023	
216120024	
216120025	
216120026	
216120027	
216120028	
216120029	
216120030	No matter what might happen...
216120031	
216120032	
216120033	
216120034	
216120035	
216120036	
216120037	
216120038	
216120039	
216120040	Ranni... She needs me...
216121000	<growling>
216800000	Oh?
216801000	What are you playing at?
216802000	Fine.
216802001	
216802002	
216802003	
216802004	
216802005	
216802006	
216802007	
216802008	
216802009	
216802010	Time to douse your little flame.
216803000	Alright then.
216803001	
216803002	
216803003	
216803004	
216803005	
216803006	
216803007	
216803008	
216803009	
216803010	Better to put you down now.
216803011	
216803012	
216803013	
216803014	
216803015	
216803016	
216803017	
216803018	
216803019	
216803020	Before you trouble mistress Ranni.
216804000	Hmph. Pathetic little man.
216804001	Hmph. Pathetic little woman.
216805000	Don't show your face again.
216805001	
216805002	
216805003	
216805004	
216805005	
216805006	
216805007	
216805008	
216805009	
216805010	Stay away from mistress Ranni.
216806000	You're...you're strong of arm.
216806001	
216806002	
216806003	
216806004	
216806005	
216806006	
216806007	
216806008	
216806009	
216806010	But ask yourself...
216806011	
216806012	
216806013	
216806014	
216806015	
216806016	
216806017	
216806018	
216806019	
216806020	What harm can be done...to a shadow?
216807000	Traitorous wretch...
216807001	
216807002	
216807003	
216807004	
216807005	
216807006	
216807007	
216807008	
216807009	
216807010	You're...you're a danger...
216807011	From... From this woman…
216808000	Stop, please...
216808001	
216808002	
216808003	
216808004	
216808005	
216808006	
216808007	
216808008	
216808009	
216808010	You think me a bringer of bale as well?
216808011	
216808012	
216808013	
216808014	
216808015	
216808016	
216808017	
216808018	
216808019	
216808020	Fine. I am Ranni's shadow and it's for her that I fight.
216808021	
216808022	
216808023	
216808024	
216808025	
216808026	
216808027	
216808028	
216808029	
216808030	Whatever any of you might call me.
216809000	I am no bringer of bale.
216809001	
216809002	
216809003	
216809004	
216809005	
216809006	
216809007	
216809008	
216809009	
216809010	I must return to Ranni's side.
216810000	Tell...me...
216810001	
216810002	
216810003	
216810004	
216810005	
216810006	
216810007	
216810008	
216810009	
216810010	Why... Why am I...bale to Ranni?
216811000	Didn't I say? No harm can befall a shadow.
216812000	I...am shadowbound.
216812001	
216812002	
216812003	
216812004	
216812005	
216812006	
216812007	
216812008	
216812009	
216812010	Wherever mistress Ranni goes, I follow.
216812011	
216812012	
216812013	
216812014	
216812015	
216812016	
216812017	
216812018	
216812019	
216812020	You are a danger. You die here.
216813000	Rraargh!
216900000	 
216900001	
216900002	
216900003	
216900004	
216900005	
216900006	
216900007	
216900008	
216900009	
216900010	 
216900011	
216900012	
216900013	
216900014	
216900015	
216900016	
216900017	
216900018	
216900019	
216900020	 
218001000	Please, wait!
218001001	
218001002	
218001003	
218001004	
218001005	
218001006	
218001007	
218001008	
218001009	
218001010	Proud Tarnished warrior. Before you kill me, let me speak.
218001011	
218001012	
218001013	
218001014	
218001015	
218001016	
218001017	
218001018	
218001019	
218001020	I can aid you. Please, just hear me out.
218002000	Thank you for listening.
218002001	
218002002	
218002003	
218002004	
218002005	
218002006	
218002007	
218002008	
218002009	
218002010	I am Asimi. My true form is that of a silver tear.
218002011	
218002012	
218002013	
218002014	
218002015	
218002016	
218002017	
218002018	
218002019	
218002020	I am a simple being who can assume the shapes of other living things.
218002021	
218002022	
218002023	
218002024	
218002025	
218002026	
218002027	
218002028	
218002029	
218002030	But now, I've gained knowledge. I speak, and ponder, and...live in fear of death.
218002031	
218002032	
218002033	
218002034	
218002035	
218002036	
218002037	
218002038	
218002039	
218002040	O, mighty Tarnished warrior, I beg of you.
218002041	
218002042	
218002043	
218002044	
218002045	
218002046	
218002047	
218002048	
218002049	
218002050	Let me keep the life I've been granted. In exchange, I offer you power.
218003000	Ahh, thank you.
218003001	
218003002	
218003003	
218003004	
218003005	
218003006	
218003007	
218003008	
218003009	
218003010	Now, set your lips upon me, and breathe in deep.
218003011	
218003012	
218003013	
218003014	
218003015	
218003016	
218003017	
218003018	
218003019	
218003020	I will live inside of you, and grant you strength untold.
218004000	Onward, to our glorious future, my host...
218005000	You won't listen to me, will you?
218005001	
218005002	
218005003	
218005004	
218005005	
218005006	
218005007	
218005008	
218005009	
218005010	It's such a pity. I had a feeling you would become...
218006000	Please, proud Tarnished warrior, I beg you reconsider.
218006001	
218006002	
218006003	
218006004	
218006005	
218006006	
218006007	
218006008	
218006009	
218006010	The gifts I can bestow you in life far outstrip those which could be plundered from my corpse.
218006011	
218006012	
218006013	
218006014	
218006015	
218006016	
218006017	
218006018	
218006019	
218006020	Please, can't you find it in your heart to trust me?
218007000	So, you won't trust me.
218007001	
218007002	
218007003	
218007004	
218007005	
218007006	
218007007	
218007008	
218007009	
218007010	But you still haven't killed me, have you.
218007011	
218007012	
218007013	
218007014	
218007015	
218007016	
218007017	
218007018	
218007019	
218007020	Do you wish to think it over? Then I will wait.
218007021	
218007022	
218007023	
218007024	
218007025	
218007026	
218007027	
218007028	
218007029	
218007030	For as long as it takes for you to trust me.
218008000	Proud Tarnished Warrior, have you made up your mind?
218008001	
218008002	
218008003	
218008004	
218008005	
218008006	
218008007	
218008008	
218008009	
218008010	I can grant you power, if you let me live.
218010000	My lord host, do you hear that?
218010001	
218010002	
218010003	
218010004	
218010005	
218010006	
218010007	
218010008	
218010009	
218010010	The sound of water. The river that flows in my home, the Eternal City.
218010011	
218010012	
218010013	
218010014	
218010015	
218010016	
218010017	
218010018	
218010019	
218010020	Good lord host, I beg you, we must see the Eternal City.
218010021	
218010022	
218010023	
218010024	
218010025	
218010026	
218010027	
218010028	
218010029	
218010030	To discover the ancient wonders of the stars. A wellspring of strength.
218020000	My lord host, great lord host.
218020001	
218020002	
218020003	
218020004	
218020005	
218020006	
218020007	
218020008	
218020009	
218020010	May I ask something of you?
218020011	
218020012	
218020013	
218020014	
218020015	
218020016	
218020017	
218020018	
218020019	
218020020	A chalice is close by, the cradle of my kind...
218020021	
218020022	
218020023	
218020024	
218020025	
218020026	
218020027	
218020028	
218020029	
218020030	Would you mind finding it for me?
218020031	
218020032	
218020033	
218020034	
218020035	
218020036	
218020037	
218020038	
218020039	
218020040	Mm, you should find the chalice...and drink it dry.
218020041	
218020042	
218020043	
218020044	
218020045	
218020046	
218020047	
218020048	
218020049	
218020050	Ahh, my lord host. I am terribly parched.
218020051	
218020052	
218020053	
218020054	
218020055	
218020056	
218020057	
218020058	
218020059	
218020060	The chalice will quench my thirst, rejuvenate my flesh, and allow me to grant you further strength.
218020061	
218020062	
218020063	
218020064	
218020065	
218020066	
218020067	
218020068	
218020069	
218020070	Please, my lord host. It is my only desire.
218021000	Bless this brook of sustenance. My lord host...
218030000	My lord host, great lord host.
218030001	
218030002	
218030003	
218030004	
218030005	
218030006	
218030007	
218030008	
218030009	
218030010	A tear chalice lies in these lands, too.
218030011	
218030012	
218030013	
218030014	
218030015	
218030016	
218030017	
218030018	
218030019	
218030020	A tear chalice lies in these lands.
218030021	
218030022	
218030023	
218030024	
218030025	
218030026	
218030027	
218030028	
218030029	
218030030	Our mother chalice.
218030031	
218030032	
218030033	
218030034	
218030035	
218030036	
218030037	
218030038	
218030039	
218030040	Please, search out this most sacred chalice.
218030041	
218030042	
218030043	
218030044	
218030045	
218030046	
218030047	
218030048	
218030049	
218030050	It's suffused with the blessed wonders of the stars...
218030051	
218030052	
218030053	
218030054	
218030055	
218030056	
218030057	
218030058	
218030059	
218030060	It will allow us to become a perfect whole.
218040000	Now, lord host.
218040001	
218040002	
218040003	
218040004	
218040005	
218040006	
218040007	
218040008	
218040009	
218040010	Please, drink every last drop from the mother chalice.
218040011	
218040012	
218040013	
218040014	
218040015	
218040016	
218040017	
218040018	
218040019	
218040020	So that we may form a perfect whole.
218041000	Oh no...
218041001	
218041002	
218041003	
218041004	
218041005	
218041006	
218041007	
218041008	
218041009	
218041010	Excuse me, lord host.
218041011	
218041012	
218041013	
218041014	
218041015	
218041016	
218041017	
218041018	
218041019	
218041020	I'm still so very, very parched.
218041021	
218041022	
218041023	
218041024	
218041025	
218041026	
218041027	
218041028	
218041029	
218041030	In the other Eternal City, there's a cradle chalice to be found.
218041031	
218041032	
218041033	
218041034	
218041035	
218041036	
218041037	
218041038	
218041039	
218041040	And if you were to drink the entirety of that one, first...
218050000	Ahh, are you awake?
218050001	
218050002	
218050003	
218050004	
218050005	
218050006	
218050007	
218050008	
218050009	
218050010	We've become a perfect whole.
218050011	
218050012	
218050013	
218050014	
218050015	
218050016	
218050017	
218050018	
218050019	
218050020	There is nothing to fear. I will merely follow in your footsteps.
218050021	
218050022	
218050023	
218050024	
218050025	
218050026	
218050027	
218050028	
218050029	
218050030	Living only as you would have yourself.
218050031	
218050032	
218050033	
218050034	
218050035	
218050036	
218050037	
218050038	
218050039	
218050040	And I vow, that when I perfect your form.
218060000	Ahh, how could you...
218060001	
218060002	
218060003	
218060004	
218060005	
218060006	
218060007	
218060008	
218060009	
218060010	I was you, and only you. We were one...together.
218060011	
218060012	
218060013	
218060014	
218060015	
218060016	
218060017	
218060018	
218060019	
218060020	Please, I only want to live...
218060021	
218060022	
218060023	
218060024	
218060025	
218060026	
218060027	
218060028	
218060029	
218060030	I only wanted you...
218060031	
218060032	
218060033	
218060034	
218060035	
218060036	
218060037	
218060038	
218060039	
218060040	to become Lord...
218060041	
218060042	
218060043	
218060044	
218060045	
218060046	
218060047	
218060048	
218060049	
218060050	Gah...
218070000	Oh...you found me...
218070001	
218070002	
218070003	
218070004	
218070005	
218070006	
218070007	
218070008	
218070009	
218070010	I had hoped you wouldn't...
218070011	
218070012	
218070013	
218070014	
218070015	
218070016	
218070017	
218070018	
218070019	
218070020	You could have become Elden Lord, and I could have become Sovereign Eternal, eventually.
218070021	
218070022	
218070023	
218070024	
218070025	
218070026	
218070027	
218070028	
218070029	
218070030	If you hadn't found me, we both could have been Lords.
218800000	I was wrong about you...
218801000	My apologies, lord host.
218801001	
218801002	
218801003	
218801004	
218801005	
218801006	
218801007	
218801008	
218801009	
218801010	I will take the throne.
218802000	I'm...dying...
218802001	
218802002	
218802003	
218802004	
218802005	
218802006	
218802007	
218802008	
218802009	
218802010	So this...is fear...
218803000	I'm...glad...
218803001	
218803002	
218803003	
218803004	
218803005	
218803006	
218803007	
218803008	
218803009	
218803010	My lord host, worthiest of lords...
218900000	 
218900001	
218900002	
218900003	
218900004	
218900005	
218900006	
218900007	
218900008	
218900009	
218900010	 
218900011	
218900012	
218900013	
218900014	
218900015	
218900016	
218900017	
218900018	
218900019	
218900020	 
219001000	Ah!
219001001	
219001002	
219001003	
219001004	
219001005	
219001006	
219001007	
219001008	
219001009	
219001010	Please, no. Dear me!
219001011	
219001012	
219001013	
219001014	
219001015	
219001016	
219001017	
219001018	
219001019	
219001020	...
219001021	
219001022	
219001023	
219001024	
219001025	
219001026	
219001027	
219001028	
219001029	
219001030	I haven't a clue.
219001031	
219001032	
219001033	
219001034	
219001035	
219001036	
219001037	
219001038	
219001039	
219001040	No secrets lie with me, not a one.
219001041	
219001042	
219001043	
219001044	
219001045	
219001046	
219001047	
219001048	
219001049	
219001050	Oh, please. Leave me be.
219002000	Wait, then, you're not one of them?
219002001	
219002002	
219002003	
219002004	
219002005	
219002006	
219002007	
219002008	
219002009	
219002010	Well, what a relief.
219002011	
219002012	
219002013	
219002014	
219002015	
219002016	
219002017	
219002018	
219002019	
219002020	...
219002021	
219002022	
219002023	
219002024	
219002025	
219002026	
219002027	
219002028	
219002029	
219002030	Oh, goodness me.
219002031	
219002032	
219002033	
219002034	
219002035	
219002036	
219002037	
219002038	
219002039	
219002040	I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see.
219002041	
219002042	
219002043	
219002044	
219002045	
219002046	
219002047	
219002048	
219002049	
219002050	We're finished. The whole village is finished.
219002051	
219002052	
219002053	
219002054	
219002055	
219002056	
219002057	
219002058	
219002059	
219002060	The cursemongers have destroyed everything. No one that remains has their wits about them.
219002061	
219002062	
219002063	
219002064	
219002065	
219002066	
219002067	
219002068	
219002069	
219002070	I beg you. Would you look after this medallion?
219002071	
219002072	
219002073	
219002074	
219002075	
219002076	
219002077	
219002078	
219002079	
219002080	You must keep it out of the cursemongers' hands.
219002081	
219002082	
219002083	
219002084	
219002085	
219002086	
219002087	
219002088	
219002089	
219002090	And if you should meet the young Albinauric Latenna,
219002091	
219002092	
219002093	
219002094	
219002095	
219002096	
219002097	
219002098	
219002099	
219002100	then please, give it to her.
219003000	A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics.
219003001	
219003002	
219003003	
219003004	
219003005	
219003006	
219003007	
219003008	
219003009	
219003010	Miquella's city, far to the north, a place called Eburion, where we are conferred eternal grace.
219003011	
219003012	
219003013	
219003014	
219003015	
219003016	
219003017	
219003018	
219003019	
219003020	The medallion is the key that leads to the city.
219003021	
219003022	
219003023	
219003024	
219003025	
219003026	
219003027	
219003028	
219003029	
219003030	It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey.
219003031	
219003032	
219003033	
219003034	
219003035	
219003036	
219003037	
219003038	
219003039	
219003040	But for dear Latenna, it is needed. To fulfil her purpose.
219004000	My legs will soon fade, and with them, my life.
219004001	
219004002	
219004003	
219004004	
219004005	
219004006	
219004007	
219004008	
219004009	
219004010	Alas, this is the immovable fate of all Albinaurics.
219004011	
219004012	
219004013	
219004014	
219004015	
219004016	
219004017	
219004018	
219004019	
219004020	...
219004021	
219004022	
219004023	
219004024	
219004025	
219004026	
219004027	
219004028	
219004029	
219004030	If only I could have gazed upon it, even once. The great chalk buttress of Eburion.
219004031	
219004032	
219004033	
219004034	
219004035	
219004036	
219004037	
219004038	
219004039	
219004040	...
219800000	Ngh!
219801000	We are Albinaurics.
219801001	
219801002	
219801003	
219801004	
219801005	
219801006	
219801007	
219801008	
219801009	
219801010	We have caused you no harm!
219802000	You merciless brutes.
219802001	
219802002	
219802003	
219802004	
219802005	
219802006	
219802007	
219802008	
219802009	
219802010	Let the curse take everything.
219803000	I will never give this up.
219803001	
219803002	
219803003	
219803004	
219803005	
219803006	
219803007	
219803008	
219803009	
219803010	Not to your kind.
219900000	 
219900001	
219900002	
219900003	
219900004	
219900005

219900028	
219900029	
219900030	 
220001000	Hello-o? Can you hear me?
220001001	
220001002	
220001003	
220001004	
220001005	
220001006	
220001007	
220001008	
220001009	
220001010	Help me! I'm stuck!
220001011	
220001012	
220001013	
220001014	
220001015	
220001016	
220001017	
220001018	
220001019	
220001020	Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?
220002000	Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you!
220002001	
220002002	
220002003	
220002004	
220002005	
220002006	
220002007	
220002008	
220002009	
220002010	I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here.
220002011	
220002012	
220002013	
220002014	
220002015	
220002016	
220002017	
220002018	
220002019	
220002020	Please, can you help me out of this?
220002021	
220002022	
220002023	
220002024	
220002025	
220002026	
220002027	
220002028	
220002029	
220002030	My thanks! A thousand thanks!
220002031	
220002032	
220002033	
220002034	
220002035	
220002036	
220002037	
220002038	
220002039	
220002040	Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.
220002041	
220002042	
220002043	
220002044	
220002045	
220002046	
220002047	
220002048	
220002049	
220002050	And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!
220002051	
220002052	
220002053	
220002054	
220002055	
220002056	
220002057	
220002058	
220002059	
220002060	Don't dally. No no, there's no need to fret, I'm very well trained.
220002061	
220002062	
220002063	
220002064	
220002065	
220002066	
220002067	
220002068	
220002069	
220002070	Give it your all, I say!
220003000	Ah!
220003001	
220003002	
220003003	
220003004	
220003005	
220003006	
220003007	
220003008	
220003009	
220003010	Ouuch!
220004000	S-stop please! That's a little too rough for me, friend.
220004001	
220004002	
220004003	
220004004	
220004005	
220004006	
220004007	
220004008	
220004009	
220004010	You'll crack me in half, like that! A little more gently, gently, please.
220005000	Ahhh!
220006000	Ahh! Well played, good sir. Well played!
220006001	Ahh! Well played, good lady. Well played!
220006002	
220006003	
220006004	
220006005	
220006006	
220006007	
220006008	
220006009	
220006010	Though that mighty wallop of yours almost spelt the end of me!
220006011	
220006012	
220006013	
220006014	
220006015	
220006016	
220006017	
220006018	
220006019	
220006020	Ha ha ha ha!
220006021	
220006022	
220006023	
220006024	
220006025	
220006026	
220006027	
220006028	
220006029	
220006030	Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.
220006031	
220006032	
220006033	
220006034	
220006035	
220006036	
220006037	
220006038	
220006039	
220006040	I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this.
220007000	Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.
220007001	
220007002	
220007003	
220007004	
220007005	
220007006	
220007007	
220007008	
220007009	
220007010	I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.
220007011	
220007012	
220007013	
220007014	
220007015	
220007016	
220007017	
220007018	
220007019	
220007020	Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
220007021	
220007022	
220007023	
220007024	
220007025	
220007026	
220007027	
220007028	
220007029	
220007030	And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.
220007031	
220007032	
220007033	
220007034	
220007035	
220007036	
220007037	
220007038	
220007039	
220007040	I'd heard whispers of such festivities before...
220007041	
220007042	
220007043	
220007044	
220007045	
220007046	
220007047	
220007048	
220007049	
220007050	Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!
220007051	
220007052	
220007053	
220007054	
220007055	
220007056	
220007057	
220007058	
220007059	
220007060	Ha ha ha ha!
220008000	I see. More's the pity.
220008001	
220008002	
220008003	
220008004	
220008005	
220008006	
220008007	
220008008	
220008009	
220008010	No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.
220008011	
220008012	
220008013	
220008014	
220008015	
220008016	
220008017	
220008018	
220008019	
220008020	Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.
220009000	Ah, what's that look, good sir?
220009001	Ah, what's that look, good lady?
220009002	
220009003	
220009004	
220009005	
220009006	
220009007	
220009008	
220009009	
220009010	Are you willing to help me out after all?
220010000	Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.
220010001	
220010002	
220010003	
220010004	
220010005	
220010006	
220010007	
220010008	
220010009	
220010010	I'll pop clean out. I'm sure, of it!
220011000	Don't stop now, friend.
220011001	
220011002	
220011003	
220011004	
220011005	
220011006	
220011007	
220011008	
220011009	
220011010	Just keeping clobbering away at the old behind!
220011011	
220011012	
220011013	
220011014	
220011015	
220011016	
220011017	
220011018	
220011019	
220011020	Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained.
220011021	
220011022	
220011023	
220011024	
220011025	
220011026	
220011027	
220011028	
220011029	
220011030	Give it your all, I say!
220012000	G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face!
220012001	
220012002	
220012003	
220012004	
220012005	
220012006	
220012007	
220012008	
220012009	
220012010	Smack me from the other end! The other end!
220013000	I'm heading eastward.
220013001	
220013002	
220013003	
220013004	
220013005	
220013006	
220013007	
220013008	
220013009	
220013010	To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
220013011	
220013012	
220013013	
220013014	
220013015	
220013016	
220013017	
220013018	
220013019	
220013020	I've heard there's to be a festival held there.
220014000	G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my lid!
220020000	Oh, I hadn't expected to see your face again.
220020001	
220020002	
220020003	
220020004	
220020005	
220020006	
220020007	
220020008	
220020009	
220020010	Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?
220020011	
220020012	
220020013	
220020014	
220020015	
220020016	
220020017	
220020018	
220020019	
220020020	Oh, no need to be coy with me.
220020021	
220020022	
220020023	
220020024	
220020025	
220020026	
220020027	
220020028	
220020029	
220020030	Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.
220020031	
220020032	
220020033	
220020034	
220020035	
220020036	
220020037	
220020038	
220020039	
220020040	The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!
220020041	
220020042	
220020043	
220020044	
220020045	
220020046	
220020047	
220020048	
220020049	
220020050	Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.
220020051	
220020052	
220020053	
220020054	
220020055	
220020056	
220020057	
220020058	
220020059	
220020060	But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.
220020061	
220020062	
220020063	
220020064	
220020065	
220020066	
220020067	
220020068	
220020069	
220020070	I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.
220020071	
220020072	
220020073	
220020074	
220020075	
220020076	
220020077	
220020078	
220020079	
220020080	It seems my calculations must have been off...
220021000	I was created to be a warrior vessel.
220021001	
220021002	
220021003	
220021004	
220021005	
220021006	
220021007	
220021008	
220021009	
220021010	Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.
220021011	
220021012	
220021013	
220021014	
220021015	
220021016	
220021017	
220021018	
220021019	
220021020	It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.
220021021	
220021022	
220021023	
220021024	
220021025	
220021026	
220021027	
220021028	
220021029	
220021030	It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.
220021031	
220021032	
220021033	
220021034	
220021035	
220021036	
220021037	
220021038	
220021039	
220021040	And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!
220021041	
220021042	
220021043	
220021044	
220021045	
220021046	
220021047	
220021048	
220021049	
220021050	What do you think, eh? How do you rate my chances?
220021051	
220021052	
220021053	
220021054	
220021055	
220021056	
220021057	
220021058	
220021059	
220021060	Heh heh...
220022000	Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.
220022001	
220022002	
220022003	
220022004	
220022005	
220022006	
220022007	
220022008	
220022009	
220022010	Are you travelling my way?
220022011	
220022012	
220022013	
220022014	
220022015	
220022016	
220022017	
220022018	
220022019	
220022020	I'm heading to the festival at Redmane Castle, on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
220022021	
220022022	
220022023	
220022024	
220022025	
220022026	
220022027	
220022028	
220022029	
220022030	Oh, no need to be coy with me.
220022031	
220022032	
220022033	
220022034	
220022035	
220022036	
220022037	
220022038	
220022039	
220022040	I can tell from your bearing you're skilled in the arts of combat.
220022041	
220022042	
220022043	
220022044	
220022045	
220022046	
220022047	
220022048	
220022049	
220022050	Ah, yes, the mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!
220022051	
220022052	
220022053	
220022054	
220022055	
220022056	
220022057	
220022058	
220022059	
220022060	I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.
220022061	
220022062	
220022063	
220022064	
220022065	
220022066	
220022067	
220022068	
220022069	
220022070	And according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.
220022071	
220022072	
220022073	
220022074	
220022075	
220022076	
220022077	
220022078	
220022079	
220022080	But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.
220022081	
220022082	
220022083	
220022084	
220022085	
220022086	
220022087	
220022088	
220022089	
220022090	I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.
220022091	
220022092	
220022093	
220022094	
220022095	
220022096	
220022097	
220022098	
220022099	
220022100	It seems my calculations must have been off...
220030000	...!
220030001	
220030002	
220030003	
220030004	
220030005	
220030006	
220030007	
220030008	
220030009	
220030010	Good sir, where did you spring from?
220030011	Good lady, where did you spring from?
220030012	
220030013	
220030014	
220030015	
220030016	
220030017	
220030018	
220030019	
220030020	This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
220030021	
220030022	
220030023	
220030024	
220030025	
220030026	
220030027	
220030028	
220030029	
220030030	What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
220030031	
220030032	
220030033	
220030034	
220030035	
220030036	
220030037	
220030038	
220030039	
220030040	Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.
220030041	
220030042	
220030043	
220030044	
220030045	
220030046	
220030047	
220030048	
220030049	
220030050	I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend.
220030051	
220030052	
220030053	
220030054	
220030055	
220030056	
220030057	
220030058	
220030059	
220030060	Heh heh...
220031000	...!
220031001	
220031002	
220031003	
220031004	
220031005	
220031006	
220031007	
220031008	
220031009	
220031010	The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from?
220031011	
220031012	
220031013	
220031014	
220031015	
220031016	
220031017	
220031018	
220031019	
220031020	This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
220031021	
220031022	
220031023	
220031024	
220031025	
220031026	
220031027	
220031028	
220031029	
220031030	What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
220031031	
220031032	
220031033	
220031034	
220031035	
220031036	
220031037	
220031038	
220031039	
220031040	Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.
220031041	
220031042	
220031043	
220031044	
220031045	
220031046	
220031047	
220031048	
220031049	
220031050	Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped!
220031051	
220031052	
220031053	
220031054	
220031055	
220031056	
220031057	
220031058	
220031059	
220031060	Heh heh...
220032000	...!
220032001	
220032002	
220032003	
220032004	
220032005	
220032006	
220032007	
220032008	
220032009	
220032010	Where did you spring from?
220032011	
220032012	
220032013	
220032014	
220032015	
220032016	
220032017	
220032018	
220032019	
220032020	This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
220032021	
220032022	
220032023	
220032024	
220032025	
220032026	
220032027	
220032028	
220032029	
220032030	What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
220032031	
220032032	
220032033	
220032034	
220032035	
220032036	
220032037	
220032038	
220032039	
220032040	Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go.
220032041	
220032042	
220032043	
220032044	
220032045	
220032046	
220032047	
220032048	
220032049	
220032050	I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.
220032051	
220032052	
220032053	
220032054	
220032055	
220032056	
220032057	
220032058	
220032059	
220032060	I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
220032061	
220032062	
220032063	
220032064	
220032065	
220032066	
220032067	
220032068	
220032069	
220032070	Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end!
220032071	
220032072	
220032073	
220032074	
220032075	
220032076	
220032077	
220032078	
220032079	
220032080	Heh heh...
220033000	It's time I set off.
220033001	
220033002	
220033003	
220033004	
220033005	
220033006	
220033007	
220033008	
220033009	
220033010	To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
220033011	
220033012	
220033013	
220033014	
220033015	
220033016	
220033017	
220033018	
220033019	
220033020	Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!
220040000	Ah, you came, how delightful!
220040001	
220040002	
220040003	
220040004	
220040005	
220040006	
220040007	
220040008	
220040009	
220040010	Indeed, I thought I might find you here.
220040011	
220040012	
220040013	
220040014	
220040015	
220040016	
220040017	
220040018	
220040019	
220040020	By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held?
220040021	
220040022	
220040023	
220040024	
220040025	
220040026	
220040027	
220040028	
220040029	
220040030	Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!
220040031	
220040032	
220040033	
220040034	
220040035	
220040036	
220040037	
220040038	
220040039	
220040040	To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...
220040041	
220040042	
220040043	
220040044	
220040045	
220040046	
220040047	
220040048	
220040049	
220040050	In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.
220040051	
220040052	
220040053	
220040054	
220040055	
220040056	
220040057	
220040058	
220040059	
220040060	But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!
220040061	
220040062	
220040063	
220040064	
220040065	
220040066	
220040067	
220040068	
220040069	
220040070	Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
220040071	
220040072	
220040073	
220040074	
220040075	
220040076	
220040077	
220040078	
220040079	
220040080	I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
220041000	Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.
220041001	
220041002	
220041003	
220041004	
220041005	
220041006	
220041007	
220041008	
220041009	
220041010	I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine.
220041011	
220041012	
220041013	
220041014	
220041015	
220041016	
220041017	
220041018	
220041019	
220041020	Do you know for whom this festival is being held?
220041021	
220041022	
220041023	
220041024	
220041025	
220041026	
220041027	
220041028	
220041029	
220041030	Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!
220041031	
220041032	
220041033	
220041034	
220041035	
220041036	
220041037	
220041038	
220041039	
220041040	To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...
220041041	
220041042	
220041043	
220041044	
220041045	
220041046	
220041047	
220041048	
220041049	
220041050	In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.
220041051	
220041052	
220041053	
220041054	
220041055	
220041056	
220041057	
220041058	
220041059	
220041060	But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!
220041061	
220041062	
220041063	
220041064	
220041065	
220041066	
220041067	
220041068	
220041069	
220041070	Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
220041071	
220041072	
220041073	
220041074	
220041075	
220041076	
220041077	
220041078	
220041079	
220041080	I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
220042000	Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
220042001	
220042002	
220042003	
220042004	
220042005	
220042006	
220042007	
220042008	
220042009	
220042010	I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
220050000	A-ah, hello there.
220050001	
220050002	
220050003	
220050004	
220050005	
220050006	
220050007	
220050008	
220050009	
220050010	It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.
220050011	
220050012	
220050013	
220050014	
220050015	
220050016	
220050017	
220050018	
220050019	
220050020	I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock.
220050021	
220050022	
220050023	
220050024	
220050025	
220050026	
220050027	
220050028	
220050029	
220050030	One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out...
220050031	
220050032	
220050033	
220050034	
220050035	
220050036	
220050037	
220050038	
220050039	
220050040	After that, I hid like a coward.
220050041	
220050042	
220050043	
220050044	
220050045	
220050046	
220050047	
220050048	
220050049	
220050050	And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.
220051000	...But don't you think I've given up just yet.
220051001	
220051002	
220051003	
220051004	
220051005	
220051006	
220051007	
220051008	
220051009	
220051010	As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.
220051011	
220051012	
220051013	
220051014	
220051015	
220051016	
220051017	
220051018	
220051019	
220051020	If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.
220051021	
220051022	
220051023	
220051024	
220051025	
220051026	
220051027	
220051028	
220051029	
220051030	And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.
220051031	
220051032	
220051033	
220051034	
220051035	
220051036	
220051037	
220051038	
220051039	
220051040	Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!
220051041	
220051042	
220051043	
220051044	
220051045	
220051046	
220051047	
220051048	
220051049	
220051050	Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!
220051051	
220051052	
220051053	
220051054	
220051055	
220051056	
220051057	
220051058	
220051059	
220051060	Just you wait, when next we meet!
220051061	
220051062	
220051063	
220051064	
220051065	
220051066	
220051067	
220051068	
220051069	
220051070	Heh heh...
220052000	Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey.
220052001	
220052002	
220052003	
220052004	
220052005	
220052006	
220052007	
220052008	
220052009	
220052010	You'll all be inside me, and be part of me.
220052011	
220052012	
220052013	
220052014	
220052015	
220052016	
220052017	
220052018	
220052019	
220052020	From now on, we're all in it together.
220052021	
220052022	
220052023	
220052024	
220052025	
220052026	
220052027	
220052028	
220052029	
220052030	So let's all of us dream big.
220053000	The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.
220053001	
220053002	
220053003	
220053004	
220053005	
220053006	
220053007	
220053008	
220053009	
220053010	Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!
220053011	
220053012	
220053013	
220053014	
220053015	
220053016	
220053017	
220053018	
220053019	
220053020	Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!
220053021	
220053022	
220053023	
220053024	
220053025	
220053026	
220053027	
220053028	
220053029	
220053030	Just you wait, when next we meet!
220053031	
220053032	
220053033	
220053034	
220053035	
220053036	
220053037	
220053038	
220053039	
220053040	Heh heh...
220060000	Hello-o? Can you hear me?
220060001	
220060002	
220060003	
220060004	
220060005	
220060006	
220060007	
220060008	
220060009	
220060010	Help me! I'm stuck!
220060011	
220060012	
220060013	
220060014	
220060015	
220060016	
220060017	
220060018	
220060019	
220060020	Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?
220061000	Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!
220061001	
220061002	
220061003	
220061004	
220061005	
220061006	
220061007	
220061008	
220061009	
220061010	As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole.
220061011	
220061012	
220061013	
220061014	
220061015	
220061016	
220061017	
220061018	
220061019	
220061020	Would you mind helping me out, again?
220061021	
220061022	
220061023	
220061024	
220061025	
220061026	
220061027	
220061028	
220061029	
220061030	My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job!
220061031	My thanks in advance, I know you're the woman for the job!
220061032	
220061033	
220061034	
220061035	
220061036	
220061037	
220061038	
220061039	
220061040	You know what to do, hm?
220061041	
220061042	
220061043	
220061044	
220061045	
220061046	
220061047	
220061048	
220061049	
220061050	Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.
220061051	
220061052	
220061053	
220061054	
220061055	
220061056	
220061057	
220061058	
220061059	
220061060	Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.
220061061	
220061062	
220061063	
220061064	
220061065	
220061066	
220061067	
220061068	
220061069	
220061070	I'm stuck back together good and proper!
220061071	
220061072	
220061073	
220061074	
220061075	
220061076	
220061077	
220061078	
220061079	
220061080	Just give it your all!
220062000	Ah!
220062001	
220062002	
220062003	
220062004	
220062005	
220062006	
220062007	
220062008	
220062009	
220062010	Ouuch!
220063000	P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this!
220063001	
220063002	
220063003	
220063004	
220063005	
220063006	
220063007	
220063008	
220063009	
220063010	Would you stop hitting me for a minute!
220064000	I see. More's the pity.
220064001	
220064002	
220064003	
220064004	
220064005	
220064006	
220064007	
220064008	
220064009	
220064010	No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.
220064011	
220064012	
220064013	
220064014	
220064015	
220064016	
220064017	
220064018	
220064019	
220064020	Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.
220065000	What's that look, good sir?
220065001	What's that look, good lady?
220065002	
220065003	
220065004	
220065005	
220065006	
220065007	
220065008	
220065009	
220065010	Are you willing to help me out after all?
220066000	Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!
220067000	I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.
220067001	
220067002	
220067003	
220067004	
220067005	
220067006	
220067007	
220067008	
220067009	
220067010	I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.
220067011	
220067012	
220067013	
220067014	
220067015	
220067016	
220067017	
220067018	
220067019	
220067020	Hmm...
220067021	
220067022	
220067023	
220067024	
220067025	
220067026	
220067027	
220067028	
220067029	
220067030	Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
220067031	
220067032	
220067033	
220067034	
220067035	
220067036	
220067037	
220067038	
220067039	
220067040	What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
220068000	Hmm...
220068001	
220068002	
220068003	
220068004	
220068005	
220068006	
220068007	
220068008	
220068009	
220068010	Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
220068011	
220068012	
220068013	
220068014	
220068015	
220068016	
220068017	
220068018	
220068019	
220068020	What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
220069000	Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!
220069001	
220069002	
220069003	
220069004	
220069005	
220069006	
220069007	
220069008	
220069009	
220069010	As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in a hole.
220069011	
220069012	
220069013	
220069014	
220069015	
220069016	
220069017	
220069018	
220069019	
220069020	Would you mind helping me out?
220070000	Ngh!
220070001	
220070002	
220070003	
220070004	
220070005	
220070006	
220070007	
220070008	
220070009	
220070010	Nngh!
220070011	
220070012	
220070013	
220070014	
220070015	
220070016	
220070017	
220070018	
220070019	
220070020	Oh, yes!
220070021	
220070022	
220070023	
220070024	
220070025	
220070026	
220070027	
220070028	
220070029	
220070030	That's the ticket!
220071000	Nnngh!
220072000	My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits.
220072001	
220072002	
220072003	
220072004	
220072005	
220072006	
220072007	
220072008	
220072009	
220072010	As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.
220073000	Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad!
220073001	
220073002	
220073003	
220073004	
220073005	
220073006	
220073007	
220073008	
220073009	
220073010	There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually.
220073011	
220073012	
220073013	
220073014	
220073015	
220073016	
220073017	
220073018	
220073019	
220073020	And now I know what it's like to be one of them!
220073021	
220073022	
220073023	
220073024	
220073025	
220073026	
220073027	
220073028	
220073029	
220073030	Heh heh...
220074000	Yes, indeed, I too have a home.
220074001	
220074002	
220074003	
220074004	
220074005	
220074006	
220074007	
220074008	
220074009	
220074010	Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.
220074011	
220074012	
220074013	
220074014	
220074015	
220074016	
220074017	
220074018	
220074019	
220074020	So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...
220074021	
220074022	
220074023	
220074024	
220074025	
220074026	
220074027	
220074028	
220074029	
220074030	Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole.
220074031	
220074032	
220074033	
220074034	
220074035	
220074036	
220074037	
220074038	
220074039	
220074040	I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness.
220074041	
220074042	
220074043	
220074044	
220074045	
220074046	
220074047	
220074048	
220074049	
220074050	To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!
220074051	
220074052	
220074053	
220074054	
220074055	
220074056	
220074057	
220074058	
220074059	
220074060	I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.
220074061	
220074062	
220074063	
220074064	
220074065	
220074066	
220074067	
220074068	
220074069	
220074070	I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.
220074071	
220074072	
220074073	
220074074	
220074075	
220074076	
220074077	
220074078	
220074079	
220074080	I will forge myself anew in its flames!
220075000	I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.
220075001	
220075002	
220075003	
220075004	
220075005	
220075006	
220075007	
220075008	
220075009	
220075010	I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.
220075011	
220075012	
220075013	
220075014	
220075015	
220075016	
220075017	
220075018	
220075019	
220075020	I will forge myself anew in its flames!
220080000	Ngh!
220080001	
220080002	
220080003	
220080004	
220080005	
220080006	
220080007	
220080008	
220080009	
220080010	Rnnngh!
220080011	
220080012	
220080013	
220080014	
220080015	
220080016	
220080017	
220080018	
220080019	
220080020	O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!
220080021	
220080022	
220080023	
220080024	
220080025	
220080026	
220080027	
220080028	
220080029	
220080030	Rrrrngh!
220081000	Nnngh!
220081001	
220081002	
220081003	
220081004	
220081005	
220081006	
220081007	
220081008	
220081009	
220081010	Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?
220081011	Ah, good lady, what business might you have in such a place as this?
220081012	
220081013	
220081014	
220081015	
220081016	
220081017	
220081018	
220081019	
220081020	I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours.
220081021	
220081022	
220081023	
220081024	
220081025	
220081026	
220081027	
220081028	
220081029	
220081030	Your timing though, is impeccable as ever!
220081031	
220081032	
220081033	
220081034	
220081035	
220081036	
220081037	
220081038	
220081039	
220081040	I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here.
220081041	
220081042	
220081043	
220081044	
220081045	
220081046	
220081047	
220081048	
220081049	
220081050	Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee.
220081051	
220081052	
220081053	
220081054	
220081055	
220081056	
220081057	
220081058	
220081059	
220081060	But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here.
220081061	
220081062	
220081063	
220081064	
220081065	
220081066	
220081067	
220081068	
220081069	
220081070	I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again.
220081071	
220081072	
220081073	
220081074	
220081075	
220081076	
220081077	
220081078	
220081079	
220081080	Perhaps I'll head eastward.
220081081	
220081082	
220081083	
220081084	
220081085	
220081086	
220081087	
220081088	
220081089	
220081090	There's an old saying I've caught wind of.
220081091	
220081092	
220081093	
220081094	
220081095	
220081096	
220081097	
220081098	
220081099	
220081100	"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."
220083000	Perhaps I'll head eastward.
220083001	
220083002	
220083003	
220083004	
220083005	
220083006	
220083007	
220083008	
220083009	
220083010	There's an old saying I've caught wind of.
220083011	
220083012	
220083013	
220083014	
220083015	
220083016	
220083017	
220083018	
220083019	
220083020	"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."
220090000	Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.
220090001	
220090002	
220090003	
220090004	
220090005	
220090006	
220090007	
220090008	
220090009	
220090010	The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.
220090011	
220090012	
220090013	
220090014	
220090015	
220090016	
220090017	
220090018	
220090019	
220090020	But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh.
220090021	
220090022	
220090023	
220090024	
220090025	
220090026	
220090027	
220090028	
220090029	
220090030	I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god...
220090031	
220090032	
220090033	
220090034	
220090035	
220090036	
220090037	
220090038	
220090039	
220090040	Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.
220090041	
220090042	
220090043	
220090044	
220090045	
220090046	
220090047	
220090048	
220090049	
220090050	Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.
220090051	
220090052	
220090053	
220090054	
220090055	
220090056	
220090057	
220090058	
220090059	
220090060	Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?
220090061	
220090062	
220090063	
220090064	
220090065	
220090066	
220090067	
220090068	
220090069	
220090070	Come and tell me when you're ready.
220090071	
220090072	
220090073	
220090074	
220090075	
220090076	
220090077	
220090078	
220090079	
220090080	I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.
220091000	You are ready then, I take it?
220091001	
220091002	
220091003	
220091004	
220091005	
220091006	
220091007	
220091008	
220091009	
220091010	Then let us begin!
220091011	
220091012	
220091013	
220091014	
220091015	
220091016	
220091017	
220091018	
220091019	
220091020	I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander!
220091021	
220091022	
220091023	
220091024	
220091025	
220091026	
220091027	
220091028	
220091029	
220091030	Lend me strength, O warriors within!
220091031	
220091032	
220091033	
220091034	
220091035	
220091036	
220091037	
220091038	
220091039	
220091040	Let us become one champion, together!
220092000	Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.
220092001	
220092002	
220092003	
220092004	
220092005	
220092006	
220092007	
220092008	
220092009	
220092010	The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.
220092011	
220092012	
220092013	
220092014	
220092015	
220092016	
220092017	
220092018	
220092019	
220092020	But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god...
220092021	
220092022	
220092023	
220092024	
220092025	
220092026	
220092027	
220092028	
220092029	
220092030	I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same.
220092031	
220092032	
220092033	
220092034	
220092035	
220092036	
220092037	
220092038	
220092039	
220092040	Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.
220092041	
220092042	
220092043	
220092044	
220092045	
220092046	
220092047	
220092048	
220092049	
220092050	Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.
220092051	
220092052	
220092053	
220092054	
220092055	
220092056	
220092057	
220092058	
220092059	
220092060	Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?
220092061	
220092062	
220092063	
220092064	
220092065	
220092066	
220092067	
220092068	
220092069	
220092070	Come and tell me when you're ready.
220092071	
220092072	
220092073	
220092074	
220092075	
220092076	
220092077	
220092078	
220092079	
220092080	I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.
220100000	As I suspected... Victory...was impossible.
220100001	
220100002	
220100003	
220100004	
220100005	
220100006	
220100007	
220100008	
220100009	
220100010	This vessel...was found lacking...
220101000	My thanks. I knew you were the stuff of champions.
220101001	
220101002	
220101003	
220101004	
220101005	
220101006	
220101007	
220101008	
220101009	
220101010	It was a marvellous battle.
220101011	
220101012	
220101013	
220101014	
220101015	
220101016	
220101017	
220101018	
220101019	
220101020	I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me...
220101021	
220101022	
220101023	
220101024	
220101025	
220101026	
220101027	
220101028	
220101029	
220101030	All vessels are destined to one day break.
220101031	
220101032	
220101033	
220101034	
220101035	
220101036	
220101037	
220101038	
220101039	
220101040	But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last!
220101041	
220101042	
220101043	
220101044	
220101045	
220101046	
220101047	
220101048	
220101049	
220101050	Ha ha ha ha!
220102000	Good sir, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.
220102001	Good lady, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.
220130000	By the gods you are a man of vision!
220130001	By the gods you are a woman of vision!
220130002	
220130003	
220130004	
220130005	
220130006	
220130007	
220130008	
220130009	
220130010	This will have me as slippery as a toad.
220130011	
220130012	
220130013	
220130014	
220130015	
220130016	
220130017	
220130018	
220130019	
220130020	I have a good feeling about this, my friend.
220130021	
220130022	
220130023	
220130024	
220130025	
220130026	
220130027	
220130028	
220130029	
220130030	Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!
220131000	Argh! Cease! Please!
220131001	
220131002	
220131003	
220131004	
220131005	
220131006	
220131007	
220131008	
220131009	
220131010	Just stop a moment, I beg!
220132000	My lower half is stuck on something down there!
220133000	I'll break! I'll break before I'm out!
220134000	Argh! No!
220134001	
220134002	
220134003	
220134004	
220134005	
220134006	
220134007	
220134008	
220134009	
220134010	Stop, please!
220134011	
220134012	
220134013	
220134014	
220134015	
220134016	
220134017	
220134018	
220134019	
220134020	I beg! I beg of you!
220135000	Argh!
220140000	Phew.
220140001	
220140002	
220140003	
220140004	
220140005	
220140006	
220140007	
220140008	
220140009	
220140010	I thought I was apt to split in half...
220140011	
220140012	
220140013	
220140014	
220140015	
220140016	
220140017	
220140018	
220140019	
220140020	Mm, I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.
220140021	
220140022	
220140023	
220140024	
220140025	
220140026	
220140027	
220140028	
220140029	
220140030	I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.
220140031	
220140032	
220140033	
220140034	
220140035	
220140036	
220140037	
220140038	
220140039	
220140040	Hmm...
220140041	
220140042	
220140043	
220140044	
220140045	
220140046	
220140047	
220140048	
220140049	
220140050	Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
220140051	
220140052	
220140053	
220140054	
220140055	
220140056	
220140057	
220140058	
220140059	
220140060	W-what if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
220141000	My thanks! A thousand thanks!
220141001	
220141002	
220141003	
220141004	
220141005	
220141006	
220141007	
220141008	
220141009	
220141010	Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.
220141011	
220141012	
220141013	
220141014	
220141015	
220141016	
220141017	
220141018	
220141019	
220141020	And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!
220141021	
220141022	
220141023	
220141024	
220141025	
220141026	
220141027	
220141028	
220141029	
220141030	Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.
220141031	
220141032	
220141033	
220141034	
220141035	
220141036	
220141037	
220141038	
220141039	
220141040	I'm stuck back together good and proper!
220141041	
220141042	
220141043	
220141044	
220141045	
220141046	
220141047	
220141048	
220141049	
220141050	Just give it your all!
220800000	Ngh!
220801000	What are you playing at?
220801001	
220801002	
220801003	
220801004	
220801005	
220801006	
220801007	
220801008	
220801009	
220801010	This is no time for games!
220802000	Wait, I see. I see it now.
220802001	
220802002	
220802003	
220802004	
220802005	
220802006	
220802007	
220802008	
220802009	
220802010	Humans all lose their wits, eventually.
220803000	Then there's nothing left to say, except...
220803001	
220803002	
220803003	
220803004	
220803005	
220803006	
220803007	
220803008	
220803009	
220803010	I am Iron Fist Alexander!
220803011	
220803012	
220803013	
220803014	
220803015	
220803016	
220803017	
220803018	
220803019	
220803020	The great jar warrior!
220810000	A finer battle was never witnessed.
220810001	
220810002	
220810003	
220810004	
220810005	
220810006	
220810007	
220810008	
220810009	
220810010	How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh?
220820000	How could this...
220820001	
220820002	
220820003	
220820004	
220820005	
220820006	
220820007	
220820008	
220820009	
220820010	Was my whole existence... just a crock?
220900000	 
220900001	
220900002	
220900003	
220900004	
220900005	
220900006	
220900007	
220900008	
220900009	
220900010	 
220900011	
220900012	
220900013	
220900014	
220900015	
220900016	
220900017	
220900018	
220900019	
220900020	 
221001000	...
223001000	Oi! You there!
223001001	
223001002	
223001003	
223001004	
223001005	
223001006	
223001007	
223001008	
223001009	
223001010	Could you help us out, cully?
223001011	
223001012	
223001013	
223001014	
223001015	
223001016	
223001017	
223001018	
223001019	
223001020	You, yeah, you there!
223001021	
223001022	
223001023	
223001024	
223001025	
223001026	
223001027	
223001028	
223001029	
223001030	Stop pretending you can't see me!
223001031	
223001032	
223001033	
223001034	
223001035	
223001036	
223001037	
223001038	
223001039	
223001040	Why won't anyone look me in the eye?
223001041	
223001042	
223001043	
223001044	
223001045	
223001046	
223001047	
223001048	
223001049	
223001050	I-I'm not that ugly, am I?
223002000	Ow!
223002001	
223002002	
223002003	
223002004	
223002005	
223002006	
223002007	
223002008	
223002009	
223002010	What'd you go and do that for!
223003000	Hm? Oh, yes, I remember.
223003001	
223003002	
223003003	
223003004	
223003005	
223003006	
223003007	
223003008	
223003009	
223003010	Some clod turned me into a tree.
223003011	
223003012	
223003013	
223003014	
223003015	
223003016	
223003017	
223003018	
223003019	
223003020	You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.
223003021	
223003022	
223003023	
223003024	
223003025	
223003026	
223003027	
223003028	
223003029	
223003030	Thank you. The name's Boc.
223003031	
223003032	
223003033	
223003034	
223003035	
223003036	
223003037	
223003038	
223003039	
223003040	I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.
223003041	
223003042	
223003043	
223003044	
223003045	
223003046	
223003047	
223003048	
223003049	
223003050	Then I ended up as a tree.
223003051	
223003052	
223003053	
223003054	
223003055	
223003056	
223003057	
223003058	
223003059	
223003060	Lucky you came along, really.
223004000	Oh, what a shame.
223004001	
223004002	
223004003	
223004004	
223004005	
223004006	
223004007	
223004008	
223004009	
223004010	When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned,
223004011	
223004012	
223004013	
223004014	
223004015	
223004016	
223004017	
223004018	
223004019	
223004020	and so this is all I have to express my thanks.
223004021	
223004022	
223004023	
223004024	
223004025	
223004026	
223004027	
223004028	
223004029	
223004030	I hope you can forgive me.
223004031	
223004032	
223004033	
223004034	
223004035	
223004036	
223004037	
223004038	
223004039	
223004040	Or, if you can afford to wait for a while,
223004041	
223004042	
223004043	
223004044	
223004045	
223004046	
223004047	
223004048	
223004049	
223004050	I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.
223004051	
223004052	
223004053	
223004054	
223004055	
223004056	
223004057	
223004058	
223004059	
223004060	Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon.
223005000	Right, but I'll need a moment.
223005001	
223005002	
223005003	
223005004	
223005005	
223005006	
223005007	
223005008	
223005009	
223005010	I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.
223005011	
223005012	
223005013	
223005014	
223005015	
223005016	
223005017	
223005018	
223005019	
223005020	My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore...
223010000	Oh, what are you doing here?
223010001	
223010002	
223010003	
223010004	
223010005	
223010006	
223010007	
223010008	
223010009	
223010010	You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.
223010011	
223010012	
223010013	
223010014	
223010015	
223010016	
223010017	
223010018	
223010019	
223010020	You'll end up just like me.
223011000	Wait, is that what I think it is?
223011001	
223011002	
223011003	
223011004	
223011005	
223011006	
223011007	
223011008	
223011009	
223011010	You got it back for me? My sewing needle!
223011011	
223011012	
223011013	
223011014	
223011015	
223011016	
223011017	
223011018	
223011019	
223011020	<sob>
223011021	
223011022	
223011023	
223011024	
223011025	
223011026	
223011027	
223011028	
223011029	
223011030	What made you go and do a thing like that...
223011031	
223011032	
223011033	
223011034	
223011035	
223011036	
223011037	
223011038	
223011039	
223011040	My mum was a seamstress...
223011041	
223011042	
223011043	
223011044	
223011045	
223011046	
223011047	
223011048	
223011049	
223011050	...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by.
223011051	
223011052	
223011053	
223011054	
223011055	
223011056	
223011057	
223011058	
223011059	
223011060	I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.
223011061	
223011062	
223011063	
223011064	
223011065	
223011066	
223011067	
223011068	
223011069	
223011070	Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I.
223012000	Thank you.
223012001	
223012002	
223012003	
223012004	
223012005	
223012006	
223012007	
223012008	
223012009	
223012010	You're very kind.
223012011	
223012012	
223012013	
223012014	
223012015	
223012016	
223012017	
223012018	
223012019	
223012020	I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum.
223012021	
223012022	
223012023	
223012024	
223012025	
223012026	
223012027	
223012028	
223012029	
223012030	Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I.
223013000	Oh...
223013001	
223013002	
223013003	
223013004	
223013005	
223013006	
223013007	
223013008	
223013009	
223013010	It...hurts...
223013011	
223013012	
223013013	
223013014	
223013015	
223013016	
223013017	
223013018	
223013019	
223013020	Ooh...
223020000	Good to see you! Master.
223020001	
223020002	
223020003	
223020004	
223020005	
223020006	
223020007	
223020008	
223020009	
223020010	Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human.
223020011	
223020012	
223020013	
223020014	
223020015	
223020016	
223020017	
223020018	
223020019	
223020020	You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.
223020021	
223020022	
223020023	
223020024	
223020025	
223020026	
223020027	
223020028	
223020029	
223020030	Please, master.
223020031	
223020032	
223020033	
223020034	
223020035	
223020036	
223020037	
223020038	
223020039	
223020040	Allow me to serve you, as your seamster.
223020041	
223020042	
223020043	
223020044	
223020045	
223020046	
223020047	
223020048	
223020049	
223020050	I can't make nothing from scratch, but…
223020051	
223020052	
223020053	
223020054	
223020055	
223020056	
223020057	
223020058	
223020059	
223020060	I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments.
223021000	Boc the seamster, at your service, Master.
223021001	
223021002	
223021003	
223021004	
223021005	
223021006	
223021007	
223021008	
223021009	
223021010	Ready to make adjustments to your garments.
223022000	Oh, going so soon?
223022001	
223022002	
223022003	
223022004	
223022005	
223022006	
223022007	
223022008	
223022009	
223022010	Please, do be safe on your journeys.
223023000	Master, I was wondering...
223023001	
223023002	
223023003	
223023004	
223023005	
223023006	
223023007	
223023008	
223023009	
223023010	Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself?
223023011	
223023012	
223023013	
223023014	
223023015	
223023016	
223023017	
223023018	
223023019	
223023020	I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please.
223023021	
223023022	
223023023	
223023024	
223023025	
223023026	
223023027	
223023028	
223023029	
223023030	I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well...
223023031	
223023032	
223023033	
223023034	
223023035	
223023036	
223023037	
223023038	
223023039	
223023040	I am your personal seamster, after all!
223023041	
223023042	
223023043	
223023044	
223023045	
223023046	
223023047	
223023048	
223023049	
223023050	I am your personal seamster, after all!
223030000	Master, my apologies.
223030001	
223030002	
223030003	
223030004	
223030005	
223030006	
223030007	
223030008	
223030009	
223030010	Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods,
223030011	
223030012	
223030013	
223030014	
223030015	
223030016	
223030017	
223030018	
223030019	
223030020	and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.
223030021	
223030022	
223030023	
223030024	
223030025	
223030026	
223030027	
223030028	
223030029	
223030030	My mum told me once.
223030031	
223030032	
223030033	
223030034	
223030035	
223030036	
223030037	
223030038	
223030039	
223030040	That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.
223030041	
223030042	
223030043	
223030044	
223030045	
223030046	
223030047	
223030048	
223030049	
223030050	Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!
223031000	Is that a gift for my undeserving self?
223031001	
223031002	
223031003	
223031004	
223031005	
223031006	
223031007	
223031008	
223031009	
223031010	Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it...
223031011	
223031012	
223031013	
223031014	
223031015	
223031016	
223031017	
223031018	
223031019	
223031020	Oh!
223031021	
223031022	
223031023	
223031024	
223031025	
223031026	
223031027	
223031028	
223031029	
223031030	Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life!
223031031	
223031032	
223031033	
223031034	
223031035	
223031036	
223031037	
223031038	
223031039	
223031040	With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...
223031041	
223031042	
223031043	
223031044	
223031045	
223031046	
223031047	
223031048	
223031049	
223031050	Are you certain that this is for me?
223031051	
223031052	
223031053	
223031054	
223031055	
223031056	
223031057	
223031058	
223031059	
223031060	Oh, I can hardly believe it.
223031061	
223031062	
223031063	
223031064	
223031065	
223031066	
223031067	
223031068	
223031069	
223031070	Have faith in me, Master!
223031071	
223031072	
223031073	
223031074	
223031075	
223031076	
223031077	
223031078	
223031079	
223031080	I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!
223031081	
223031082	
223031083	
223031084	
223031085	
223031086	
223031087	
223031088	
223031089	
223031090	I'll be the golden seamster, Boc!
223031091	
223031092	
223031093	
223031094	
223031095	
223031096	
223031097	
223031098	
223031099	
223031100	Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!
223032000	Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew?
223032001	
223032002	
223032003	
223032004	
223032005	
223032006	
223032007	
223032008	
223032009	
223032010	That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now.
223032011	
223032012	
223032013	
223032014	
223032015	
223032016	
223032017	
223032018	
223032019	
223032020	Oh, it's still not enough.
223032021	
223032022	
223032023	
223032024	
223032025	
223032026	
223032027	
223032028	
223032029	
223032030	I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her.
223040000	Master, may I ask you something?
223040001	
223040002	
223040003	
223040004	
223040005	
223040006	
223040007	
223040008	
223040009	
223040010	Would you mind if I called you lord?
223040011	
223040012	
223040013	
223040014	
223040015	
223040016	
223040017	
223040018	
223040019	
223040020	I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.
223040021	
223040022	
223040023	
223040024	
223040025	
223040026	
223040027	
223040028	
223040029	
223040030	Well, I know that you will be the one,
223040031	
223040032	
223040033	
223040034	
223040035	
223040036	
223040037	
223040038	
223040039	
223040040	and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for.
223040041	
223040042	
223040043	
223040044	
223040045	
223040046	
223040047	
223040048	
223040049	
223040050	So, please, if you would.
223040051	
223040052	
223040053	
223040054	
223040055	
223040056	
223040057	
223040058	
223040059	
223040060	Allow me to call you lord.
223041000	You don't say! Thank you, thank you!
223041001	
223041002	
223041003	
223041004	
223041005	
223041006	
223041007	
223041008	
223041009	
223041010	M'lord, m'lord, m'lord!
223041011	
223041012	
223041013	
223041014	
223041015	
223041016	
223041017	
223041018	
223041019	
223041020	Please, become Elden Lord.
223041021	
223041022	
223041023	
223041024	
223041025	
223041026	
223041027	
223041028	
223041029	
223041030	And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side.
223042000	No, and why would you...
223042001	
223042002	
223042003	
223042004	
223042005	
223042006	
223042007	
223042008	
223042009	
223042010	Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it.
223043000	Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord.
223043001	
223043002	
223043003	
223043004	
223043005	
223043006	
223043007	
223043008	
223043009	
223043010	Ready to make adjustments to your garments.
223044000	Going already, m'lord?
223044001	
223044002	
223044003	
223044004	
223044005	
223044006	
223044007	
223044008	
223044009	
223044010	Please, do be safe on your journeys.
223045000	Master, did you see it?
223045001	
223045002	
223045003	
223045004	
223045005	
223045006	
223045007	
223045008	
223045009	
223045010	Th-the Erdtree?
223045011	
223045012	
223045013	
223045014	
223045015	
223045016	
223045017	
223045018	
223045019	
223045020	I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...
223045021	
223045022	
223045023	
223045024	
223045025	
223045026	
223045027	
223045028	
223045029	
223045030	But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.
223045031	
223045032	
223045033	
223045034	
223045035	
223045036	
223045037	
223045038	
223045039	
223045040	The Erdtree is waiting for you, master.
223045041	
223045042	
223045043	
223045044	
223045045	
223045046	
223045047	
223045048	
223045049	
223045050	I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.
223046000	M'lord, did you see it?
223046001	
223046002	
223046003	
223046004	
223046005	
223046006	
223046007	
223046008	
223046009	
223046010	Th-the Erdtree?
223046011	
223046012	
223046013	
223046014	
223046015	
223046016	
223046017	
223046018	
223046019	
223046020	I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...
223046021	
223046022	
223046023	
223046024	
223046025	
223046026	
223046027	
223046028	
223046029	
223046030	But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.
223046031	
223046032	
223046033	
223046034	
223046035	
223046036	
223046037	
223046038	
223046039	
223046040	The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord.
223046041	
223046042	
223046043	
223046044	
223046045	
223046046	
223046047	
223046048	
223046049	
223046050	I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.
223046051	
223046052	
223046053	
223046054	
223046055	
223046056	
223046057	
223046058	
223046059	
223046060	O please, take the throne of Elden Lord.
223050000	M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again?
223050001	
223050002	
223050003	
223050004	
223050005	
223050006	
223050007	
223050008	
223050009	
223050010	Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria
223050011	
223050012	
223050013	
223050014	
223050015	
223050016	
223050017	
223050018	
223050019	
223050020	has the power to help people be reborn.
223050021	
223050022	
223050023	
223050024	
223050025	
223050026	
223050027	
223050028	
223050029	
223050030	Oh? Me? Reborn?
223050031	
223050032	
223050033	
223050034	
223050035	
223050036	
223050037	
223050038	
223050039	
223050040	Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly...
223050041	
223050042	
223050043	
223050044	
223050045	
223050046	
223050047	
223050048	
223050049	
223050050	well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.
223051000	M'lord, what's this?
223051001	
223051002	
223051003	
223051004	
223051005	
223051006	
223051007	
223051008	
223051009	
223051010	Oh! Oh!
223051011	
223051012	
223051013	
223051014	
223051015	
223051016	
223051017	
223051018	
223051019	
223051020	It can't be… For my rebirth?
223051021	
223051022	
223051023	
223051024	
223051025	
223051026	
223051027	
223051028	
223051029	
223051030	But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me?
223051031	
223051032	
223051033	
223051034	
223051035	
223051036	
223051037	
223051038	
223051039	
223051040	Oh...
223051041	
223051042	
223051043	
223051044	
223051045	
223051046	
223051047	
223051048	
223051049	
223051050	M'lord, how did you know?
223051051	
223051052	
223051053	
223051054	
223051055	
223051056	
223051057	
223051058	
223051059	
223051060	It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance.
223052000	M'lord, it shouldn't take me long.
223052001	
223052002	
223052003	
223052004	
223052005	
223052006	
223052007	
223052008	
223052009	
223052010	I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria.
223052011	
223052012	
223052013	
223052014	
223052015	
223052016	
223052017	
223052018	
223052019	
223052020	I'll be reborn, fresh and new.
223053000	M'lord.
223053001	
223053002	
223053003	
223053004	
223053005	
223053006	
223053007	
223053008	
223053009	
223053010	In all honesty, what do you think of me?
223053011	
223053012	
223053013	
223053014	
223053015	
223053016	
223053017	
223053018	
223053019	
223053020	Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?
223053021	
223053022	
223053023	
223053024	
223053025	
223053026	
223053027	
223053028	
223053029	
223053030	Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?
223053031	
223053032	
223053033	
223053034	
223053035	
223053036	
223053037	
223053038	
223053039	
223053040	Oh, I'm such a fool.
223053041	
223053042	
223053043	
223053044	
223053045	
223053046	
223053047	
223053048	
223053049	
223053050	I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions.
223054000	Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again?
223055000	Master, what's this?
223055050	Master, how did you know?
223056000	Master, it shouldn't take me long.
223057000	Master.
223057020	Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness?
223060000	Did I just hear my mum speaking?
223060001	
223060002	
223060003	
223060004	
223060005	
223060006	
223060007	
223060008	
223060009	
223060010	Thank you very much.
223060011	
223060012	
223060013	
223060014	
223060015	
223060016	
223060017	
223060018	
223060019	
223060020	Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.
223060021	
223060022	
223060023	
223060024	
223060025	
223060026	
223060027	
223060028	
223060029	
223060030	And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice.
223060031	
223060032	
223060033	
223060034	
223060035	
223060036	
223060037	
223060038	
223060039	
223060040	Please, if I may dream, just once...
223060041	
223060042	
223060043	
223060044	
223060045	
223060046	
223060047	
223060048	
223060049	
223060050	Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord?
223060051	
223060052	
223060053	
223060054	
223060055	
223060056	
223060057	
223060058	
223060059	
223060060	Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?
223061000	<sob>
223061001	
223061002	
223061003	
223061004	
223061005	
223061006	
223061007	
223061008	
223061009	
223061010	M'lord, my dear lord...
223061011	
223061012	
223061013	
223061014	
223061015	
223061016	
223061017	
223061018	
223061019	
223061020	I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.
223061021	
223061022	
223061023	
223061024	
223061025	
223061026	
223061027	
223061028	
223061029	
223061030	May the throne of Elden Lord be yours.
223062000	No, why on earth would you...
223062001	
223062002	
223062003	
223062004	
223062005	
223062006	
223062007	
223062008	
223062009	
223062010	It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.
223062011	
223062012	
223062013	
223062014	
223062015	
223062016	
223062017	
223062018	
223062019	
223062020	But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.
223062021	
223062022

223062028	
223062029	
223062030	One day, I'll look every bit the servant.
223065000	Did I just hear my mum speaking?
223065001	
223065002	
223065003	
223065004	
223065005	
223065006	
223065007	
223065008	
223065009	
223065010	Thank you very much.

223065017	
223065018	
223065019	
223065020	Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.
223065021	
223065022	
223065023	
223065024	
223065025	
223065026	
223065027	
223065028	
223065029	
223065030	And now, my kind master let me hear her voice.
223065031	
223065032	
223065033	
223065034	
223065035	
223065036	
223065037	
223065038	
223065039	
223065040	Please, if I may dream, just once...
223065041	
223065042	
223065043	
223065044	
223065045	
223065046	
223065047	
223065048	
223065049	
223065050	Do you feel the same way my mum did, master?
223065051	
223065052	
223065053	
223065054	
223065055	
223065056	
223065057	
223065058	
223065059	
223065060	Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?
223066000	<sob>

223066003	
223066004

223066007	
223066008	
223066009	
223066010	Master, kind master...
223066011	
223066012	
223066013	
223066014	
223066015	
223066016	
223066017	
223066018	
223066019	
223066020	I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.
223067000	No, why on earth would you...
223067001	
223067002	
223067003	
223067004	
223067005	
223067006	
223067007	
223067008	
223067009	
223067010	It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.
223067011	
223067012	
223067013	
223067014	
223067015	
223067016	
223067017	
223067018	
223067019	
223067020	But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.
223067021	
223067022	
223067023	
223067024	
223067025	
223067026	
223067027	
223067028	
223067029	
223067030	One day, I'll look every bit the servant.
223100000	S-surely, not? For me?!
223100001	
223100002	
223100003	
223100004	
223100005	
223100006	
223100007	
223100008	
223100009	
223100010	Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me.
223100011	
223100012	
223100013	
223100014	
223100015	
223100016	
223100017	
223100018	
223100019	
223100020	You should drink it yourself, master.
223100021	
223100022	
223100023	
223100024	
223100025	
223100026	
223100027	
223100028	
223100029	
223100030	I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself.
223101000	S-surely, not? For me?!
223101001	
223101002	
223101003	
223101004	
223101005	
223101006	
223101007	
223101008	
223101009	
223101010	Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me.
223101011	
223101012	
223101013	
223101014	
223101015

223101017	
223101018	
223101019	
223101020	You should drink it yourself, m'lord.

223101028	
223101029	
223101030	I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself.
223102000	Master...

223102030	I don't deserve it, but I'll savour every last drop.
223103000	M'lord...

223800017	
223800018	
223800019	
223800020	It's because I'm ugly, isn't it?

224010006	
224010007	
224010008	
224010009	
224010010	I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals…
224010011	
224010012	
224010013	
224010014	
224010015	
224010016	
224010017	
224010018	
224010019	
224010020	An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer.
224010021	
224010022	
224010023	
224010024	
224010025	
224010026	
224010027	
224010028	
224010029	
224010030	So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot.
224010031	
224010032	
224010033	
224010034	
224010035	
224010036	
224010037	
224010038	
224010039	
224010040	Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able.
224011000	Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again.
224011001	
224011002	
224011003	
224011004	
224011005	
224011006	
224011007	
224011008	
224011009	
224011010	Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less?
224012000	Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again?
224013000	Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please.
224013001	
224013002	
224013003	
224013004	
224013005	
224013006	
224013007	
224013008	
224013009	
224013010	This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.
224013011	
224013012	
224013013	
224013014	
224013015	
224013016	
224013017	
224013018	
224013019	
224013020	When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.
224013021	
224013022	
224013023	
224013024	
224013025	
224013026	
224013027	
224013028	
224013029	
224013030	After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.
224013031	
224013032	
224013033	
224013034	
224013035	
224013036	
224013037	
224013038	
224013039	
224013040	The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...
224013041	
224013042	
224013043	
224013044	
224013045	
224013046	
224013047	
224013048	
224013049	
224013050	By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.
224013051	
224013052	
224013053	
224013054	
224013055	
224013056	
224013057	
224013058	
224013059	
224013060	That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.
224013061	
224013062	
224013063	
224013064	
224013065	
224013066	
224013067	
224013068	
224013069	
224013070	Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo.
224014000	Oh, watch out, there.
224014001	
224014002	
224014003	
224014004	
224014005	
224014006	
224014007	
224014008	
224014009	
224014010	When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.
224014011	
224014012	
224014013	
224014014	
224014015	
224014016	
224014017	
224014018	
224014019	
224014020	If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.
224014021	
224014022	
224014023	
224014024	
224014025	
224014026	
224014027	
224014028	
224014029	
224014030	I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished.
224014031	
224014032	
224014033	
224014034	
224014035	
224014036	
224014037	
224014038	
224014039	
224014040	You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work.
224015000	Something else for you?
224016000	I've explained the peril.
224016001	
224016002	
224016003	
224016004	
224016005	
224016006	
224016007	
224016008	
224016009	
224016010	Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor.
224016011	
224016012	
224016013	
224016014	
224016015	
224016016	
224016017	
224016018	
224016019	
224016020	Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap.
224017000	Blaidd actually did that, did he?
224017001	
224017002	
224017003	
224017004	
224017005	
224017006	
224017007	
224017008	
224017009	
224017010	Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he.
224017011	
224017012	
224017013	
224017014	
224017015	
224017016	
224017017	
224017018	
224017019	
224017020	Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you.
224017021	
224017022	
224017023	
224017024	
224017025	
224017026	
224017027	
224017028	
224017029	
224017030	At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd,
224017031	
224017032	
224017033	
224017034	
224017035	
224017036	
224017037	
224017038	
224017039	
224017040	I've a few more things that might suit you.
224017041	
224017042	
224017043	
224017044	
224017045	
224017046	
224017047	
224017048	
224017049	
224017050	I've something else that might suit you.
224020000	Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
224020040	Again, I am Iji.
224020041	
224020042	
224020043	
224020044	
224020045	
224020046	
224020047	
224020048	
224020049	
224020050	The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
224020051	
224020052	
224020053	
224020054	
224020055	
224020056	
224020057	
224020058	
224020059	
224020060	I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.
224020061	
224020062	
224020063	
224020064	
224020065	
224020066	
224020067	
224020068	
224020069	
224020070	I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.
224023020	The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
224023021	
224023022	
224023023	
224023024	
224023025	
224023026	
224023027	
224023028	
224023029	
224023030	I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.
224023031	
224023032	
224023033	
224023034	
224023035	
224023036	
224023037	
224023038	
224023039	
224023040	I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.
224024000	Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
224024001	
224024002	
224024003	
224024004	
224024005	
224024006	
224024007	
224024008	
224024009	
224024010	The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.
224030000	I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella?
224030001	
224030002	
224030003	
224030004	
224030005	
224030006	
224030007	
224030008	
224030009	
224030010	Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City.
224030011	
224030012	
224030013	
224030014	
224030015	
224030016	
224030017	
224030018	
224030019	
224030020	After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron.
224030021	
224030022	
224030023	
224030024	
224030025	
224030026	
224030027	
224030028	
224030029	
224030030	By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.
224030031	
224030032	
224030033	
224030034	
224030035	
224030036	
224030037	
224030038	
224030039	
224030040	Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city.
224030041	
224030042	
224030043	
224030044	
224030045	
224030046	
224030047	
224030048	
224030049	
224030050	Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped.
224030051	
224030052	
224030053	
224030054	
224030055	
224030056	
224030057	
224030058	
224030059	
224030060	To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here...
224031000	Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother.
224031001	
224031002	
224031003	
224031004	
224031005	
224031006	
224031007	
224031008	
224031009	
224031010	Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.
224031011	
224031012	
224031013	
224031014	
224031015	
224031016	
224031017	
224031018	
224031019	
224031020	They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.
224031021	
224031022	
224031023	
224031024	
224031025	
224031026	
224031027	
224031028	
224031029	
224031030	When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean,
224031031	
224031032	
224031033	
224031034	
224031035	
224031036	
224031037	
224031038	
224031039	
224031040	Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals,
224031041	
224031042	
224031043	
224031044	
224031045	
224031046	
224031047	
224031048	
224031049	
224031050	but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together.
224031051	
224031052	
224031053	
224031054	
224031055	
224031056	
224031057	
224031058	
224031059	
224031060	Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you?
224031061	
224031062	
224031063	
224031064	
224031065	
224031066	
224031067	
224031068	
224031069	
224031070	The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.
224032000	Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.
224032001	
224032002	
224032003	
224032004	
224032005	
224032006	
224032007	
224032008	
224032009	
224032010	Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.
224032011	
224032012	
224032013	
224032014	
224032015	
224032016	
224032017	
224032018	
224032019	
224032020	An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.
224032021	
224032022	
224032023	
224032024	
224032025	
224032026	
224032027	
224032028	
224032029	
224032030	No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.
224032031	
224032032	
224032033	
224032034	
224032035	
224032036	
224032037	
224032038	
224032039	
224032040	Oh, no, wait...
224032041	
224032042	
224032043	
224032044	
224032045	
224032046	
224032047	
224032048	
224032049	
224032050	How did I not see it before!
224032051	
224032052	
224032053	
224032054	
224032055	
224032056	
224032057	
224032058	
224032059	
224032060	I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!
224032061	
224032062	
224032063	
224032064	
224032065	
224032066	
224032067	
224032068	
224032069	
224032070	Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.
224032071	
224032072	
224032073	
224032074	
224032075	
224032076	
224032077	
224032078	
224032079	
224032080	As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.
224032081	
224032082	
224032083	
224032084	
224032085	
224032086	
224032087	
224032088	
224032089	
224032090	But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.
224032091	
224032092	
224032093	
224032094	
224032095	
224032096	
224032097	
224032098	
224032099	
224032100	Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.
224032101	
224032102	
224032103	
224032104	
224032105	
224032106	
224032107	
224032108	
224032109	
224032110	And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.
224032111	
224032112	
224032113	
224032114	
224032115	
224032116	
224032117	
224032118	
224032119	
224032120	As would Lady Ranni's destiny.
224032121

224032126	
224032127	
224032128	
224032129	
224032130	Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron.
224033000	My apologies for the misleading words of warning.
224033001	
224033002	
224033003	
224033004	
224033005	
224033006	
224033007	
224033008	
224033009	
224033010	I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.
224033011	
224033012	
224033013	
224033014	
224033015	
224033016	
224033017	
224033018	
224033019	
224033020	I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.
224033021	
224033022	
224033023	
224033024	
224033025	
224033026	
224033027	
224033028	
224033029	
224033030	Do forgive me, my fellow.
224033031	
224033032	
224033033	
224033034	
224033035	
224033036	
224033037	
224033038	
224033039	
224033040	Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
224033041	
224033042	
224033043	
224033044	
224033045	
224033046	
224033047	
224033048	
224033049	
224033050	Together, for Lady Ranni.
224034000	Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
224034001	
224034002	
224034003	
224034004	
224034005	
224034006	
224034007	
224034008	
224034009	
224034010	Together, for Lady Ranni.
224035000	Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
224035001	
224035002	
224035003	
224035004	
224035005	
224035006	
224035007	
224035008	
224035009	
224035010	Together, for Lady Ranni.
224036000	Well, my fellow. How may I serve you?
224036001	
224036002	
224036003	
224036004	
224036005	
224036006	
224036007	
224036008	
224036009	
224036010	As war counsellor, or as blacksmith?
224037000	Greetings, my fellow. How can I help?
224038000	Something else for you?
224039000	Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.
224039001	
224039002	
224039003	
224039004	
224039005	
224039006	
224039007	
224039008	
224039009	
224039010	Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.
224039011	
224039012	
224039013	
224039014	
224039015	
224039016	
224039017	
224039018	
224039019	
224039020	Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron.
224040000	Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.
224040001	
224040002	
224040003	
224040004	
224040005	
224040006	
224040007	
224040008	
224040009	
224040010	You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
224040011	
224040012	
224040013	
224040014	
224040015	
224040016	
224040017	
224040018	
224040019	
224040020	The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness,\nbut not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.
224040021	
224040022	
224040023	
224040024	
224040025	
224040026	
224040027	
224040028	
224040029	
224040030	There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.
224040031	
224040032	
224040033	
224040034	
224040035	
224040036	
224040037	
224040038	
224040039	
224040040	Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.
224040041	
224040042	
224040043	
224040044	
224040045	
224040046	
224040047	
224040048	
224040049	
224040050	Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
224040051	
224040052	
224040053	
224040054	
224040055	
224040056	
224040057	
224040058	
224040059	
224040060	And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
224041000	Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.
224041001	
224041002	
224041003	
224041004	
224041005	
224041006	
224041007	
224041008	
224041009	
224041010	Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.
224041011	
224041012	
224041013	
224041014	
224041015	
224041016	
224041017	
224041018	
224041019	
224041020	Blaidd has been given an important task.
224041021	
224041022	
224041023	
224041024	
224041025	
224041026	
224041027	
224041028	
224041029	
224041030	Apparently, a matter of great urgency.
224042000	You need not await Blaidd.
224042001	
224042002	
224042003	
224042004	
224042005	
224042006	
224042007	
224042008	
224042009	
224042010	Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
224042011	
224042012	
224042013	
224042014	
224042015	
224042016	
224042017	
224042018	
224042019	
224042020	And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
224042021	
224042022	
224042023	
224042024	
224042025	
224042026	
224042027	
224042028	
224042029	
224042030	So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.
224050000	Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated...
224050001	
224050002	
224050003	
224050004	
224050005	
224050006	
224050007	
224050008	
224050009	
224050010	Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.
224050011	
224050012	
224050013	
224050014	
224050015	
224050016	
224050017	
224050018	
224050019	
224050020	Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.
224050021	
224050022	
224050023	
224050024	
224050025	
224050026	
224050027	
224050028	
224050029	
224050030	Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.
224050031	
224050032	
224050033	
224050034	
224050035	
224050036	
224050037	
224050038	
224050039	
224050040	With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...
224050041	
224050042	
224050043	
224050044	
224050045	
224050046	
224050047	
224050048	
224050049	
224050050	Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed...
224051000	Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.
224051001	
224051002	
224051003	
224051004	
224051005	
224051006	
224051007	
224051008	
224051009	
224051010	Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.
224051011	
224051012	
224051013	
224051014	
224051015	
224051016	
224051017	
224051018	
224051019	
224051020	An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.
224051021	
224051022	
224051023	
224051024	
224051025	
224051026	
224051027	
224051028	
224051029	
224051030	It's funny how things happen.
224051031	
224051032	
224051033	
224051034	
224051035	
224051036	
224051037	
224051038	
224051039	
224051040	Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.
224051041	
224051042	
224051043	
224051044	
224051045	
224051046	
224051047	
224051048	
224051049	
224051050	I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...
224060000	I presume you've spoken with Blaidd?
224060001	
224060002	
224060003	
224060004	
224060005	
224060006	
224060007	
224060008	
224060009	
224060010	Very well. There is something you should know.
224060011	
224060012	
224060013	
224060014	
224060015	
224060016	
224060017	
224060018	
224060019	
224060020	The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.
224060021	
224060022	
224060023	
224060024	
224060025	
224060026	
224060027	
224060028	
224060029	
224060030	But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,
224060031	
224060032	
224060033	
224060034	
224060035	
224060036	
224060037	
224060038	
224060039	
224060040	the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.
224060041	
224060042	
224060043	
224060044	
224060045	
224060046	
224060047	
224060048	
224060049	
224060050	But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.
224060051	
224060052	
224060053	
224060054	
224060055	
224060056	
224060057	
224060058	
224060059	
224060060	It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake.
224070000	Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...
224070001	
224070002	
224070003	
224070004	
224070005	
224070006	
224070007	
224070008	
224070009	
224070010	How did he break free from his cell?
224070011	
224070012	
224070013	
224070014	
224070015	
224070016	
224070017	
224070018	
224070019	
224070020	No, more importantly...
224070021	
224070022	
224070023	
224070024	
224070025	
224070026	
224070027	
224070028	
224070029	
224070030	Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.
224070031	
224070032	
224070033	
224070034	
224070035	
224070036	
224070037	
224070038	
224070039	
224070040	I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...
224070041	
224070042	
224070043	
224070044	
224070045	
224070046	
224070047	
224070048	
224070049	
224070050	I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.
224070051	
224070052	
224070053	
224070054	
224070055	
224070056	
224070057	
224070058	
224070059	
224070060	When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology.
224100000	Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
224100001	
224100002	
224100003	
224100004	
224100005	
224100006	
224100007	
224100008	
224100009	
224100010	You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
224100011	
224100012	
224100013	
224100014	
224100015	
224100016	
224100017	
224100018	
224100019	
224100020	A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.
224100021	
224100022	
224100023	
224100024	
224100025	
224100026	
224100027	
224100028	
224100029	
224100030	Again, I am Iji.
224100031	
224100032	
224100033	
224100034	
224100035	
224100036	
224100037	
224100038	
224100039	
224100040	The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
224100041	
224100042	
224100043	
224100044	
224100045	
224100046	
224100047	
224100048	
224100049	
224100050	I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.
224101000	Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.
224101001	
224101002	
224101003	
224101004	
224101005	
224101006	
224101007	
224101008	
224101009	
224101010	Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
224101011	
224101012	
224101013	
224101014	
224101015	
224101016	
224101017	
224101018	
224101019	
224101020	And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
224101021	
224101022	
224101023	
224101024	
224101025	
224101026	
224101027	
224101028	
224101029	
224101030	So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.
224102000	Oh, so you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
224102001	
224102002	
224102003	
224102004	
224102005	
224102006	
224102007	
224102008	
224102009	
224102010	You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
224102011	
224102012	
224102013	
224102014	
224102015	
224102016	
224102017	
224102018	
224102019	
224102020	A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.
224102021	
224102022	
224102023	
224102024	
224102025	
224102026	
224102027	
224102028	
224102029	
224102030	The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.
224102031

224102033	
224102034	
224102035	
224102036	
224102037	
224102038	
224102039	
224102040	The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
224102041	
224102042	
224102043	
224102044	
224102045

224102047	
224102048	
224102049	
224102050	I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.
224150000	Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop by.
224150001	
224150002	
224150003

224150007	
224150008	
224150009	
224150010	Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.
224150011	
224150012	
224150013	
224150014	
224150015	
224150016	
224150017	
224150018	
224150019	
224150020	Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.
224150021	
224150022	
224150023	
224150024	
224150025	
224150026	
224150027	
224150028	
224150029	
224150030	It would not have been possible without you.
224150031	
224150032	
224150033	
224150034	
224150035	
224150036	
224150037	
224150038	
224150039	
224150040	As Lady Ranni's war counsellor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude.
224150041	
224150042	
224150043	
224150044	
224150045	
224150046	
224150047	
224150048	
224150049	
224150050	You, and only you, were Lady Ranni's true champion.
224151000	My purpose is nearing its end.
224151001	
224151002	
224151003	
224151004	
224151005	
224151006	
224151007	
224151008	
224151009	
224151010	I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...
224151011	
224151012	
224151013	
224151014	
224151015	
224151016	
224151017	
224151018	
224151019	
224151020	It has been a long and wondrous journey.
224151021	
224151022	
224151023	
224151024	
224151025	
224151026	
224151027	
224151028	
224151029	
224151030	Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.
224151031	
224151032	
224151033

224151037	
224151038	
224151039	
224151040	I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.
224152000	Well, what's this?
224152001	
224152002	
224152003	
224152004	
224152005

224152007	
224152008	
224152009	
224152010	Are you certain? This is a fine reserve.
224152011	
224152012	
224152013	
224152014	
224152015	
224152016	
224152017	
224152018	
224152019	
224152020	Perhaps you knew that Old Iji appreciates a good drink.
224152021	
224152022	
224152023	
224152024	
224152025	
224152026	
224152027	
224152028	
224152029	
224152030	I'll save it for a quiet moment, that I might truly savour it.
224153000	Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.
224153001	
224153002	
224153003	
224153004	
224153005	
224153006	
224153007

224800000	Ngh!
224801000	Enough of that, Tarnished.

224801010	There is no fight without a foe.

224810000	Agh.
224811000	Cease this treachery at once.

224811007	
224811008	
224811009	
224811010	Lady Ranni will be devastated.
224812000	This is a true shame.

226004040	Have you noticed the rare flowers growing in this village?
226004041	I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them.

226030018	
226030019	
226030020	He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion.
226030021	
226030022

226030030	I asked to go with him, but he said "The path of champions must be trod alone".
226030031	
226030032	
226030033	
226030034	
226030035

226030037	
226030038	
226030039	
226030040	So heroic, right? I miss him though.

226031000	Uncle Alexander said he won't be back again.
226031001	
226031002

226031039	
226031040	I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander.

226031046	
226031047	
226031048	
226031049	
226031050	And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion.
226032000	Uncle Alexander won't come back here again.
226032001	
226032002	
226032003

226040020	They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away.

226050011	
226050012	
226050013	
226050014	
226050015

226050017	
226050018	
226050019	
226050020	I think he said his name was Diallos.
226050021	
226050022	
226050023	
226050024	
226050025	
226050026	
226050027	
226050028	
226050029	
226050030	He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk!
226051000	I don't know, I'm a little disappointed actually.
226051001	
226051002	
226051003

226051005	
226051006	
226051007	
226051008	
226051009	
226051010	Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour...
226051011	
226051012	
226051013	
226051014	
226051015	
226051016	
226051017	
226051018	
226051019	
226051020	He says he isn't a warrior.
226051021	
226051022	
226051023	
226051024	
226051025	
226051026	
226051027	
226051028	
226051029	
226051030	And since he's a coward, he won't be fighting anymore.
226051031	
226051032	
226051033	
226051034	
226051035	
226051036	
226051037	
226051038	
226051039	
226051040	His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us.

226804042	
226804043	
226804044	
226804045	
226804046	
226804047	
226804048	
226804049	
226804050	...
226900000	 
226900100	 
226900200	 
227001000	Sister... Where did you go?
227001001	
227001002	
227001003	
227001004	
227001005	
227001006	
227001007	
227001008	
227001009	
227001010	You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars...
227001011	
227001012	
227001013	
227001014	
227001015	
227001016	
227001017	
227001018	
227001019	
227001020	I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever, it seems.
227002000	Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here.
227002001	
227002002	
227002003	
227002004	
227002005	
227002006	
227002007	
227002008	
227002009	
227002010	No time to waste. Let's see the stars.
228001000	Foul Tarnished, what do you want?
228001001	
228001002	
228001003	
228001004	
228001005	
228001006	
228001007	
228001008	
228001009	
228001010	I told the all-hearing brute.
228001011	
228001012	
228001013	
228001014	
228001015	
228001016	
228001017	
228001018	
228001019	
228001020	That I possess no such medallion.
228001021	
228001022	
228001023	
228001024	
228001025	
228001026	
228001027	
228001028	
228001029	
228001030	Or have you come to take more from me?
228001031	
228001032	
228001033	
228001034	
228001035	
228001036	
228001037	
228001038	
228001039	
228001040	Was my other half not enough?
228001041	
228001042	
228001043	
228001044	
228001045	
228001046	
228001047	
228001048	
228001049	
228001050	I told the bastard in the bone armour.
228002000	I told the all-hearing brute already.
228002001	
228002002	
228002003	
228002004	
228002005	
228002006	
228002007	
228002008	
228002009	
228002010	That I possess no such medallion.
228002011	
228002012	
228002013	
228002014	
228002015	
228002016	
228002017	
228002018	
228002019	
228002020	Or have you come to take more from me?
228002021	
228002022	
228002023	
228002024	
228002025	
228002026	
228002027	
228002028	
228002029	
228002030	Was my other half not enough?
228002031	
228002032	
228002033	
228002034	
228002035	
228002036	
228002037	
228002038	
228002039	
228002040	I told the bastard in bone armour already.
228010000	Oh...do you speak true?
228010001	
228010002	
228010003	
228010004	
228010005	
228010006	
228010007	
228010008	
228010009	
228010010	So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you.
228010011	
228010012	
228010013	
228010014	
228010015	
228010016	
228010017	
228010018	
228010019	
228010020	...
228010021	
228010022	
228010023	
228010024	
228010025	
228010026	
228010027	
228010028	
228010029	
228010030	Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will.
228010031	
228010032	
228010033	
228010034	
228010035	
228010036	
228010037	
228010038	
228010039	
228010040	Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus.
228010041	
228010042	
228010043	
228010044	
228010045	
228010046	
228010047	
228010048	
228010049	
228010050	My apologies for my coarse words earlier.
228010051	
228010052	
228010053	
228010054	
228010055	
228010056	
228010057	
228010058	
228010059	
228010060	I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute.
228010061	
228010062	
228010063	
228010064	
228010065	
228010066	
228010067	
228010068	
228010069	
228010070	I hope that you will forgive me.
228010071	
228010072	
228010073	
228010074	
228010075	
228010076	
228010077	
228010078	
228010079	
228010080	I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like the bastard before.
228011000	Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway.
228011001	
228011002	
228011003	
228011004	
228011005	
228011006	
228011007	
228011008	
228011009	
228011010	Would you consider doing me a great service?
228011011	
228011012	
228011013	
228011014	
228011015	
228011016	
228011017	
228011018	
228011019	
228011020	I must go back.
228011021	
228011022	
228011023	
228011024	
228011025	
228011026	
228011027	
228011028	
228011029	
228011030	There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo.
228011031	
228011032	
228011033	
228011034	
228011035	
228011036	
228011037	
228011038	
228011039	
228011040	Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
228011041	
228011042	
228011043	
228011044	
228011045	
228011046	
228011047	
228011048	
228011049	
228011050	If you accept, I would gladly apprise you.
228011051	
228011052	
228011053	
228011054	
228011055	
228011056	
228011057	
228011058	
228011059	
228011060	Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half.
228012000	Thank you kindly.
228012001	
228012002	
228012003	
228012004	
228012005	
228012006	
228012007	
228012008	
228012009	
228012010	They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
228012011	
228012012	
228012013	
228012014	
228012015	
228012016	
228012017	
228012018	
228012019	
228012020	In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
228012021	
228012022	
228012023	
228012024	
228012025	
228012026	
228012027	
228012028	
228012029	
228012030	
228012031	
228012032	
228012033	
228012034	
228012035	
228012036	
228012037	
228012038	
228012039	
228012040	
228012041	
228012042	
228012043	
228012044	
228012045	
228012046	
228012047	
228012048	
228012049	
228012050	
228013000	Then I suppose it's time.
228013001	
228013002	
228013003	
228013004	
228013005	
228013006	
228013007	
228013008	
228013009	
228013010	Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.
228013011	
228013012	
228013013	
228013014	
228013015	
228013016	
228013017	
228013018	
228013019	
228013020	I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.
228013021	
228013022	
228013023	
228013024	
228013025	
228013026	
228013027	
228013028	
228013029	
228013030	Forgive me, Lobo.
228013031	
228013032	
228013033	
228013034	
228013035	
228013036	
228013037	
228013038	
228013039	
228013040	...
228014000	Call upon me when needed.
228014001	
228014002	
228014003	
228014004	
228014005	
228014006	
228014007	
228014008	
228014009	
228014010	And I will fight at your side.
228015000	Well...
228015001	
228015002	
228015003	
228015004	
228015005	
228015006	
228015007	
228015008	
228015009	
228015010	I understand. You must have your own duty to fulfil.
228015011	
228015012	
228015013	
228015014	
228015015	
228015016	
228015017	
228015018	
228015019	
228015020	But please, allow me to say my piece.
228015021	
228015022	
228015023	
228015024	
228015025	
228015026	
228015027	
228015028	
228015029	
228015030	Even if you cannot take me, old Albus wished I relay to you the following:
228015031	
228015032	
228015033	
228015034	
228015035	
228015036	
228015037	
228015038	
228015039	
228015040	The other half of the medallion can be found beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
228015041	
228015042	
228015043	
228015044	
228015045	
228015046	
228015047	
228015048	
228015049	
228015050	In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
228016000	If you seek the other half of the medallion, they say it's beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
228016001	
228016002	
228016003	
228016004	
228016005	
228016006	
228016007	
228016008	
228016009	
228016010	In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
228017000	My thanks...
228017001	
228017002	
228017003	
228017004	
228017005	
228017006	
228017007	
228017008	
228017009	
228017010	You'll lead me then, to the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
228017011	
228017012	
228017013	
228017014	
228017015	
228017016	
228017017	
228017018	
228017019	
228017020	Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.
228017021	
228017022	
228017023	
228017024	
228017025	
228017026	
228017027	
228017028	
228017029	
228017030	I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.
228017031	
228017032	
228017033	
228017034	
228017035	
228017036	
228017037	
228017038	
228017039	
228017040	Forgive me, Lobo.
228017041	
228017042	
228017043	
228017044	
228017045	
228017046	
228017047	
228017048	
228017049	
228017050	...
228018000	Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.
228018001	
228018002	
228018003	
228018004	
228018005	
228018006	
228018007	
228018008	
228018009	
228018010	We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north,
228018011	
228018012	
228018013	
228018014	
228018015	
228018016	
228018017	
228018018	
228018019	
228018020	where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.
228019000	Castle Sol lies just off to the north,
228019001	
228019002	
228019003	
228019004	
228019005	
228019006	
228019007	
228019008	
228019009	
228019010	where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.
228020000	Oh young yet towering sister of ours.
228020001	
228020002	
228020003	
228020004	
228020005	
228020006	
228020007	
228020008	
228020009	
228020010	Let the birthing droplet in.
228020011	
228020012	
228020013	
228020014	
228020015	
228020016	
228020017	
228020018	
228020019	
228020020	And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics.
228021000	Thank you.
228021001	
228021002	
228021003	
228021004	
228021005	
228021006	
228021007	
228021008	
228021009	
228021010	I've finally fulfilled my purpose.
228021011	
228021012	
228021013	
228021014	
228021015

228021020	Our young yet towering sister will give us hope.
228021021	
228021022	
228021023	
228021024	
228021025	
228021026	
228021027	
228021028	
228021029	
228021030	Now that nothing is left unfinished,
228021031	
228021032	
228021033	
228021034	
228021035	
228021036	
228021037	
228021038	
228021039	
228021040	I will join you in battle to the bitter end.
228021041	
228021042	
228021043	
228021044	
228021045	
228021046	
228021047	
228021048	
228021049	
228021050	And when the fighting is done,
228021051	
228021052	
228021053	
228021054	
228021055	
228021056	
228021057	
228021058	
228021059	
228021060	then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf.
228021061	
228021062	
228021063	
228021064	
228021065	
228021066	
228021067	
228021068	
228021069	
228021070	...
228030000	Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.
228030001	
228030002	
228030003	
228030004	
228030005	
228030006	
228030007	
228030008	
228030009	
228030010	We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels.
228030011	
228030012	
228030013	
228030014	
228030015	
228030016	
228030017	
228030018	
228030019	
228030020	It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home.
228030021	
228030022	
228030023	
228030024	
228030025	
228030026	
228030027	
228030028	
228030029	
228030030	These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.
228030031	
228030032	
228030033	
228030034	
228030035	
228030036	
228030037	
228030038	
228030039	
228030040	And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,
228030041	
228030042	
228030043	
228030044	
228030045	
228030046	
228030047	
228030048	
228030049	
228030050	lies the place to which I must return.
228031000	We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
228031001	
228031002	
228031003	
228031004	
228031005	
228031006	
228031007	
228031008	
228031009	
228031010	These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.
228031011	
228031012	
228031013	
228031014	
228031015	
228031016	
228031017	
228031018	
228031019	
228031020	And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,
228031021	
228031022	
228031023	
228031024	
228031025	
228031026	
228031027	
228031028	
228031029	
228031030	lies the place to which I must return.
228800000	Ngh!
228801000	Stop, now.
228801001	
228801002	
228801003	
228801004	
228801005	
228801006	
228801007	
228801008	
228801009	
228801010	And I'll consider that a simple mishap.
228802000	Are all you Tarnished the same?
228802001	
228802002	
228802003	
228802004	
228802005	
228802006	
228802007	
228802008	
228802009	
228802010	Was taking my other half not enough for you?
228803000	There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty.
228804000	Ohh...Phillia
228804001	
228804002	
228804003	
228804004	
228804005	
228804006	
228804007	
228804008	
228804009	
228804010	Take...the birthing...droplet...
228900000	 
228900001	
228900002	
228900003	
228900004

228900017	
228900018	
228900019	
228900020	 
300001000	Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor.
300001001	
300001002	
300001003	
300001004	
300001005	
300001006	
300001007	
300001008	
300001009	
300001010	I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house.
300001011	
300001012	
300001013	
300001014	
300001015	
300001016	
300001017	
300001018	
300001019	
300001020	Rya spoke well of you.
300001021	
300001022	
300001023	
300001024	
300001025	
300001026	
300001027	
300001028	
300001029	
300001030	"A warrior of promise," I believe she said.
300001031	
300001032	
300001033	
300001034	
300001035	
300001036	
300001037	
300001038	
300001039	
300001040	Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment.
300001041	
300001042	
300001043	
300001044	
300001045	
300001046	
300001047	
300001048	
300001049	
300001050	Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide?
300001051	
300001052	
300001053	
300001054	
300001055	
300001056	
300001057	
300001058	
300001059	
300001060	Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?
300001061	
300001062	
300001063	
300001064	
300001065	
300001066	
300001067	
300001068	
300001069	
300001070	Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
300002000	Interesting. Your decision is most welcome.
300002001	
300002002	
300002003	
300002004	
300002005	
300002006	
300002007	
300002008	
300002009	
300002010	Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
300002011	
300002012	
300002013	
300002014	
300002015	
300002016	
300002017	
300002018	
300002019	
300002020	The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
300002021	
300002022	
300002023	
300002024	
300002025	
300002026	
300002027	
300002028	
300002029	
300002030	But be sure to earn your keep.
300003000	Well. That is unfortunate.
300003001	
300003002	
300003003	
300003004	
300003005	
300003006	
300003007	
300003008	
300003009	
300003010	Rya will be disappointed, but I won't twist your arm.
300003011	
300003012	
300003013	
300003014	
300003015	
300003016	
300003017	
300003018	
300003019	
300003020	Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
300003021	
300003022	
300003023	
300003024	
300003025	
300003026	
300003027	
300003028	
300003029	
300003030	Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
300004000	Aren't you precocious.
300004001	
300004002	
300004003	
300004004	
300004005	
300004006	
300004007	
300004008	
300004009	
300004010	We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation.
300004011	
300004012	
300004013	
300004014	
300004015	
300004016	
300004017	
300004018	
300004019	
300004020	Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago…
300004021	
300004022	
300004023	
300004024	
300004025	
300004026	
300004027	
300004028	
300004029	
300004030	So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts?
300004031	
300004032	
300004033	
300004034	
300004035	
300004036	
300004037	
300004038	
300004039	
300004040	About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?
300004041	
300004042	
300004043	
300004044	
300004045	
300004046	
300004047	
300004048	
300004049	
300004050	If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us?
300004051	
300004052	
300004053	
300004054	
300004055	
300004056	
300004057	
300004058	
300004059	
300004060	Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
300005000	Your decision is most welcome.
300005001	
300005002	
300005003	
300005004	
300005005	
300005006	
300005007	
300005008	
300005009	
300005010	Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
300005011	
300005012	
300005013	
300005014	
300005015	
300005016	
300005017	
300005018	
300005019	
300005020	The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
300005021	
300005022	
300005023	
300005024	
300005025	
300005026	
300005027	
300005028	
300005029	
300005030	I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you.
300006000	Well. That is unfortunate.
300006001	
300006002	
300006003	
300006004	
300006005	
300006006	
300006007	
300006008	
300006009	
300006010	Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
300006011	
300006012	
300006013	
300006014	
300006015	
300006016	
300006017	
300006018	
300006019	
300006020	Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
300007000	Did you read the letter left for you?
300007001	
300007002	
300007003	
300007004	
300007005	
300007006	
300007007	
300007008	
300007009	
300007010	That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.
300007011	
300007012	
300007013	
300007014	
300007015	
300007016	
300007017	
300007018	
300007019	
300007020	You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.
300007021	
300007022	
300007023	
300007024	
300007025	
300007026	
300007027	
300007028	
300007029	
300007030	If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it.
300007031	
300007032	
300007033	
300007034	
300007035	
300007036	
300007037	
300007038	
300007039	
300007040	But you must leave this house at once.
300007041	
300007042	
300007043	
300007044	
300007045	
300007046	
300007047	
300007048	
300007049	
300007050	This is a war against the Erdtree.
300007051	
300007052	
300007053	
300007054	
300007055	
300007056	
300007057	
300007058	
300007059	
300007060	We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands.
300008000	What's this?
300008001	
300008002	
300008003	
300008004	
300008005	
300008006	
300008007	
300008008	
300008009	
300008010	Have you reconsidered the prospect?
300008011	
300008012	
300008013	
300008014	
300008015	
300008016	
300008017	
300008018	
300008019	
300008020	Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?
300009000	Very well.
300009001	
300009002	
300009003	
300009004	
300009005	
300009006	
300009007	
300009008	
300009009	
300009010	Your decision is most welcome.
300009011	
300009012	
300009013	
300009014	
300009015	
300009016	
300009017	
300009018	
300009019	
300009020	Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
300009021	
300009022	
300009023	
300009024	
300009025	
300009026	
300009027	
300009028	
300009029	
300009030	The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
300010000	You've completed your task.
300010001	
300010002	
300010003	
300010004	
300010005	
300010006	
300010007	
300010008	
300010009	
300010010	I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.
300010011	
300010012	
300010013	
300010014	
300010015	
300010016	
300010017	
300010018	
300010019	
300010020	This is your reward, as promised.
300010021	
300010022	
300010023	
300010024	
300010025	
300010026	
300010027	
300010028	
300010029	
300010030	Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion.
300010031	
300010032	
300010033	
300010034	
300010035	
300010036	
300010037	
300010038	
300010039	
300010040	The way is tainted, but for this very reason,
300010041	
300010042	
300010043	
300010044	
300010045	
300010046	
300010047	
300010048	
300010049	
300010050	it is the true path to valour.
300011000	
300011001	
300011002	
300011003	
300011004	
300011005	
300011006	
300011007	
300011008	
300011009	
300011010	
300011011	
300011012	
300011013	
300011014	
300011015	
300011016	
300011017	
300011018	
300011019	
300011020	
300011021	
300011022	
300011023	
300011024	
300011025	
300011026	
300011027	
300011028	
300011029	
300011030	
300012000	I see you've performed another task for us.
300012001	
300012002	
300012003	
300012004	
300012005	
300012006	
300012007	
300012008	
300012009	
300012010	Here is your usual reward. Please, take it.
300012011	
300012012	
300012013	
300012014	
300012015	
300012016	
300012017	
300012018	
300012019	
300012020	Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you.
300012021	
300012022	
300012023	
300012024	
300012025	
300012026	
300012027	
300012028	
300012029	
300012030	Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.
300012031	
300012032	
300012033	
300012034	
300012035	
300012036	
300012037	
300012038	
300012039	
300012040	The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.
300012041	
300012042	
300012043	
300012044	
300012045	
300012046	
300012047	
300012048	
300012049	
300012050	But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task.
300012051	
300012052	
300012053	
300012054	
300012055	
300012056	
300012057	
300012058	
300012059	
300012060	The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.
300012061	
300012062	
300012063	
300012064	
300012065	
300012066	
300012067	
300012068	
300012069	
300012070	Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.
300012071	
300012072	
300012073	
300012074	
300012075	
300012076	
300012077	
300012078	
300012079	
300012080	Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.
300012081	
300012082	
300012083	
300012084	
300012085	
300012086	
300012087	
300012088	
300012089	
300012090	If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,
300012091	
300012092	
300012093	
300012094	
300012095	
300012096	
300012097	
300012098	
300012099	
300012100	then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.
300012101	
300012102	
300012103	
300012104	
300012105	
300012106	
300012107	
300012108	
300012109	
300012110	We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.
300012111	
300012112	
300012113	
300012114	
300012115	
300012116	
300012117	
300012118	
300012119	
300012120	If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.
300012121	
300012122	
300012123	
300012124	
300012125	
300012126	
300012127	
300012128	
300012129	
300012130	The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.
300012131	
300012132	
300012133	
300012134	
300012135	
300012136	
300012137	
300012138	
300012139	
300012140	It cannot come a day too soon!
300013000	The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.
300013001	
300013002	
300013003	
300013004	
300013005	
300013006	
300013007	
300013008	
300013009	
300013010	You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.
300014000	If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.
300014001	
300014002	
300014003	
300014004	
300014005	
300014006	
300014007	
300014008	
300014009	
300014010	It cannot come a day too soon!
300021000	She said that, to you?
300021001	
300021002	
300021003	
300021004	
300021005	
300021006	
300021007	
300021008	
300021009	
300021010	I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough.
300021011	
300021012	
300021013	
300021014	
300021015	
300021016	
300021017	
300021018	
300021019	
300021020	Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.
300021021	
300021022	
300021023	
300021024	
300021025	
300021026	
300021027	
300021028	
300021029	
300021030	That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.
300021031	
300021032	
300021033	
300021034	
300021035	
300021036	
300021037	
300021038	
300021039	
300021040	Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself.
300021041	
300021042	
300021043	
300021044	
300021045	
300021046	
300021047	
300021048	
300021049	
300021050	What matters one's lineage in such a crisis?
300022000	No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere.
300022001	
300022002	
300022003	
300022004	
300022005	
300022006	
300022007	
300022008	
300022009	
300022010	And she has no scouting duties now.
300022011	
300022012	
300022013	
300022014	
300022015	
300022016	
300022017	
300022018	
300022019	
300022020	Has she gone off in search of answers?
300022021	
300022022	
300022023	
300022024	
300022025	
300022026	
300022027	
300022028	
300022029	
300022030	Why won't she just listen...
300023000	May I ask your aid?
300023001	
300023002	
300023003	
300023004	
300023005	
300023006	
300023007	
300023008	
300023009	
300023010	Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother.
300023011	
300023012	
300023013	
300023014	
300023015	
300023016	
300023017	
300023018	
300023019	
300023020	If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress,
300023021	
300023022	
300023023	
300023024	
300023025	
300023026	
300023027	
300023028	
300023029	
300023030	have her drink this potion.
300023031	
300023032	
300023033	
300023034	
300023035	
300023036	
300023037	
300023038	
300023039	
300023040	To purge that which would cause her pain.
300024000	Yes, I know.
300024001	
300024002	
300024003	
300024004	
300024005	
300024006	
300024007	
300024008	
300024009	
300024010	My wish is a grave disrespect to her.
300024011	
300024012	
300024013	
300024014	
300024015	
300024016	
300024017	
300024018	
300024019	
300024020	No different than the Erdtree's imposition.
300024021	
300024022	
300024023	
300024024	
300024025	
300024026	
300024027	
300024028	
300024029	
300024030	But I've no choice... It must be done.
300025000	Thank you, for allowing me this.
300025001	
300025002	
300025003	
300025004	
300025005	
300025006	
300025007	
300025008	
300025009	
300025010	I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail.
300025011	
300025012	
300025013	
300025014	
300025015	
300025016	
300025017	
300025018	
300025019	
300025020	Our Lord must have known this all along.
300025021	
300025022	
300025023	
300025024	
300025025	
300025026	
300025027	
300025028	
300025029	
300025030	My meekness is all too clear...
300026000	Really, she is dead, then...
300026001	
300026002	
300026003	
300026004	
300026005	
300026006	
300026007	
300026008	
300026009	
300026010	My gratitude for your forthrightness.
300026011	
300026012	
300026013	
300026014	
300026015	
300026016	
300026017	
300026018	
300026019	
300026020	If you would...allow me some time alone.
300029000	Please, allow me some time alone.
300030000	I see that you've stayed the path of champions.
300030001	
300030002	
300030003	
300030004	
300030005	
300030006	
300030007	
300030008	
300030009	
300030010	This is your usual reward. Please, take it.
300030011	
300030012	
300030013	
300030014	
300030015	
300030016	
300030017	
300030018	
300030019	
300030020	Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord?
300030021	
300030022	
300030023	
300030024	
300030025	
300030026	
300030027	
300030028	
300030029	
300030030	Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.
300031000	Yes, as it should be.
300031001	
300031002	
300031003	
300031004	
300031005	
300031006	
300031007	
300031008	
300031009	
300031010	Now, close your eyes for a moment.
300031011	
300031012	
300031013	
300031014	
300031015	
300031016	
300031017	
300031018	
300031019	
300031020	I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.
300031021	
300031022	
300031023	
300031024	
300031025	
300031026	
300031027	
300031028	
300031029	
300031030	Farewell, then.
300031031	
300031032	
300031033	
300031034	
300031035	
300031036	
300031037	
300031038	
300031039	
300031040	May your visit be fruitful.
300032000	I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap.
300032001	
300032002	
300032003	
300032004	
300032005	
300032006	
300032007	
300032008	
300032009	
300032010	But do know this.
300032011	
300032012	
300032013	
300032014	
300032015	
300032016	
300032017	
300032018	
300032019	
300032020	To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential.
300032021	
300032022	
300032023	
300032024	
300032025	
300032026	
300032027	
300032028	
300032029	
300032030	In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree.
300032031	
300032032	
300032033	
300032034	
300032035	
300032036	
300032037	
300032038	
300032039	
300032040	Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor.
300033000	Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord?
300033001	
300033002	
300033003	
300033004	
300033005	
300033006	
300033007	
300033008	
300033009	
300033010	Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.
300040000	You...
300040001	
300040002	
300040003	
300040004	
300040005	
300040006	
300040007	
300040008	
300040009	
300040010	It's true then. You've defeated our Lord.
300040011	
300040012	
300040013	
300040014	
300040015	
300040016	
300040017	
300040018	
300040019	
300040020	No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that.
300040021	
300040022	
300040023	
300040024	
300040025	
300040026	
300040027	
300040028	
300040029	
300040030	Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger.
300040031	
300040032	
300040033	
300040034	
300040035	
300040036	
300040037	
300040038	
300040039	
300040040	Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part.
300041000	I will leave the Volcano Manor before long.
300041001	
300041002	
300041003	
300041004	
300041005	
300041006	
300041007	
300041008	
300041009	
300041010	I suggest you do the same.
300041011	
300041012	
300041013	
300041014	
300041015	
300041016	
300041017	
300041018	
300041019	
300041020	Here is my thanks. For allowing our Lord to be revived, even stronger than before.
300041021	
300041022	
300041023	
300041024	
300041025	
300041026	
300041027	
300041028	
300041029	
300041030	I will miss these encounters.
300041031	
300041032	
300041033	
300041034	
300041035	
300041036	
300041037	
300041038	
300041039	
300041040	The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more.
300041041	
300041042	
300041043	
300041044	
300041045	
300041046	
300041047	
300041048	
300041049	
300041050	I always was an admirer.
300050000	Oh, you...
300050001	
300050002	
300050003	
300050004	
300050005	
300050006	
300050007	
300050008	
300050009	
300050010	Allow me some time.
300050011	
300050012	
300050013	
300050014	
300050015	
300050016	
300050017	
300050018	
300050019	
300050020	Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed.
300050021	
300050022	
300050023	
300050024	
300050025	
300050026	
300050027	
300050028	
300050029	
300050030	Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,
300050031	
300050032	
300050033	
300050034	
300050035	
300050036	
300050037	
300050038	
300050039	
300050040	I wish to be your serpent; your family.
300050041	
300050042	
300050043	
300050044	
300050045	
300050046	
300050047	
300050048	
300050049	
300050050	One day, let us devour the gods together.
300051000	Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,
300051001	
300051002	
300051003	
300051004	
300051005	
300051006	
300051007	
300051008	
300051009	
300051010	I wish to be your serpent; your family.
300051011	
300051012	
300051013	
300051014	
300051015	
300051016	
300051017	
300051018	
300051019	
300051020	One day, let us devour the gods together.
300076000	Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
300076001	
300076002	
300076003	
300076004	
300076005	
300076006	
300076007	
300076008	
300076009	
300076010	Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
300077000	The drawing room is through the hall.
300077001	
300077002	
300077003	
300077004	
300077005	
300077006	
300077007	
300077008	
300077009	
300077010	Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.
300078000	What's this?
300078001	
300078002	
300078003	
300078004	
300078005	
300078006	
300078007	
300078008	
300078009	
300078010	Have you reconsidered the prospect?
300078011	
300078012	
300078013	
300078014	
300078015	
300078016	
300078017	
300078018	
300078019	
300078020	Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?
300079000	Very well.
300079001	
300079002	
300079003	
300079004	
300079005	
300079006	
300079007	
300079008	
300079009	
300079010	Your decision is most welcome.
300079011	
300079012	
300079013	
300079014	
300079015	
300079016	
300079017	
300079018	
300079019	
300079020	Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
300079021	
300079022	
300079023	
300079024	
300079025	
300079026	
300079027	
300079028	
300079029	
300079030	The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
300080000	Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
300080001	
300080002	
300080003	
300080004	
300080005	
300080006	
300080007	
300080008	
300080009	
300080010	Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
300081000	The drawing room is through the hall.
300081001	
300081002	
300081003	
300081004	
300081005	
300081006	
300081007	
300081008	
300081009	
300081010	Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.
300082000	Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.
300082001	
300082002	
300082003	
300082004	
300082005	
300082006	
300082007	
300082008	
300082009	
300082010	I am pleased to have you on our side.
300110000	Did you see her?
300110001	
300110002	
300110003	
300110004	
300110005	
300110006	
300110007	
300110008	
300110009	
300110010	The girl, Rya…with her true face.
300110011	
300110012	
300110013	
300110014	
300110015	
300110016	
300110017	
300110018	
300110019	
300110020	...
300110021	
300110022	
300110023	
300110024	
300110025	
300110026	
300110027	
300110028	
300110029	
300110030	Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas,
300110031	
300110032	
300110033	
300110034	
300110035	
300110036	
300110037	
300110038	
300110039	
300110040	then perhaps it is not my place to speak.
300110041	
300110042	
300110043	
300110044	
300110045	
300110046	
300110047	
300110048	
300110049	
300110050	But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you.
300110051	
300110052	
300110053	
300110054	
300110055	
300110056	
300110057	
300110058	
300110059	
300110060	Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.
300110061	
300110062	
300110063	
300110064	
300110065	
300110066	
300110067	
300110068	
300110069	
300110070	Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.
300110071	
300110072	
300110073	
300110074	
300110075	
300110076	
300110077	
300110078	
300110079	
300110080	…Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.
300111000	Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.
300111001	
300111002	
300111003	
300111004	
300111005	
300111006	
300111007	
300111008	
300111009	
300111010	Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.
300112000	Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.
300112001	
300112002	
300112003	
300112004	
300112005	
300112006	
300112007	
300112008	
300112009	
300112010	That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.
300113000	My wish is a grave disrespect to her.
300113001	
300113002	
300113003	
300113004	
300113005	
300113006	
300113007	
300113008	
300113009	
300113010	But I've no choice... It must be done.
300114000	Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?
300200000	This is farewell.
300200001	
300200002	
300200003	
300200004	
300200005	
300200006	
300200007	
300200008	
300200009	
300200010	Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.
300201000	What is it?
300201001	
300201002	
300201003	
300201004	
300201005	
300201006	
300201007	
300201008	
300201009	
300201010	I have no need of that.
300201011	
300201012	
300201013	
300201014	
300201015	
300201016	
300201017	
300201018	
300201019	
300201020	I must continue devouring my beloved lord...
300202000	Oh, you...
300202001	
300202002	
300202003	
300202004	
300202005	
300202006	
300202007	
300202008	
300202009	
300202010	Allow me some time.
300202011	
300202012	
300202013	
300202014	
300202015	
300202016	
300202017	
300202018	
300202019	
300202020	Our lord's carcass is not easily consumed.
300800000	 
300800001	
300800002	
300800003	
300800004	
300800005	
300800006	
300800007	
300800008	
300800009	
300800010	 
300801000	Ngh!
300801001	
300801002	
300801003	
300801004	
300801005	
300801006	
300801007	
300801008	
300801009	
300801010	Ahh, my lord...
300801011	
300801012	
300801013	
300801014	
300801015	
300801016	
300801017	
300801018	
300801019	
300801020	Rykard...
300900000	Oh, Rykard…
300900001	
300900002	
300900003	
300900004	
300900005	
300900006	
300900007	
300900008	
300900009	
300900010	Let me be your serpent…
301001000	Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?
301001001	
301001002	
301001003	
301001004	
301001005	
301001006	
301001007	
301001008	
301001009	
301001010	Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?
301001011	
301001012	
301001013	
301001014	
301001015	
301001016	
301001017	
301001018	
301001019	
301001020	Of course you have. No shame in it.
301001021	
301001022	
301001023	
301001024	
301001025	
301001026	
301001027	
301001028	
301001029	
301001030	But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck.
301001031	
301001032	
301001033	
301001034	
301001035	
301001036	
301001037	
301001038	
301001039	
301001040	You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes.
301001041	
301001042	
301001043	
301001044	
301001045	
301001046	
301001047	
301001048	
301001049	
301001050	Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere.
301002000	Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament?
301002001	
301002002	
301002003	
301002004	
301002005	
301002006	
301002007	
301002008	
301002009	
301002010	It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot.
301002011	
301002012	
301002013	
301002014	
301002015	
301002016	
301002017	
301002018	
301002019	
301002020	Fine, then.
301002021	
301002022	
301002023	
301002024	
301002025	
301002026	
301002027	
301002028	
301002029	
301002030	If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education.
301002031	
301002032	
301002033	
301002034	
301002035	
301002036	
301002037	
301002038	
301002039	
301002040	On the ways of the learned Tarnished.
301002041	
301002042	
301002043	
301002044	
301002045	
301002046	
301002047	
301002048	
301002049	
301002050	Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.
301002051	
301002052	
301002053	
301002054	
301002055	
301002056	
301002057	
301002058	
301002059	
301002060	You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.
301002061	
301002062	
301002063	
301002064	
301002065	
301002066	
301002067	
301002068	
301002069	
301002070	That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.
301002071	
301002072	
301002073	
301002074	
301002075	
301002076	
301002077	
301002078	
301002079	
301002080	It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you,
301002081	
301002082	
301002083	
301002084	
301002085	
301002086	
301002087	
301002088	
301002089	
301002090	maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity.
301003000	What's the matter?
301003001	
301003002	
301003003	
301003004	
301003005	
301003006	
301003007	
301003008	
301003009	
301003010	Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such?
301003011	
301003012	
301003013	
301003014	
301003015	
301003016	
301003017	
301003018	
301003019	
301003020	Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace.
301003021	
301003022	
301003023	
301003024	
301003025	
301003026	
301003027	
301003028	
301003029	
301003030	To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff.
301003031	
301003032	
301003033	
301003034	
301003035	
301003036	
301003037	
301003038	
301003039	
301003040	And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,
301003041	
301003042	
301003043	
301003044	
301003045	
301003046	
301003047	
301003048	
301003049	
301003050	you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…
301004000	Guidance will show the way, most certainly.
301004001	
301004002	
301004003	
301004004	
301004005	
301004006	
301004007	
301004008	
301004009	
301004010	To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.
301004011	
301004012	
301004013	
301004014	
301004015	
301004016	
301004017	
301004018	
301004019	
301004020	The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.
301004021	
301004022	
301004023	
301004024	
301004025	
301004026	
301004027	
301004028	
301004029	
301004030	Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm.
301004031	
301004032	
301004033	
301004034	
301004035	
301004036	
301004037	
301004038	
301004039	
301004040	Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless.
301004041	
301004042	
301004043	
301004044	
301004045	
301004046	
301004047	
301004048	
301004049	
301004050	Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,
301004051	
301004052	
301004053	
301004054	
301004055	
301004056	
301004057	
301004058	
301004059	
301004060	you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…
301011000	Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?
301011001	
301011002	
301011003	
301011004	
301011005	
301011006	
301011007	
301011008	
301011009	
301011010	Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?
301011011	
301011012	
301011013	
301011014	
301011015	
301011016	
301011017	
301011018	
301011019	
301011020	Of course you have. No shame in it.
301011021	
301011022	
301011023	
301011024	
301011025	
301011026	
301011027	
301011028	
301011029	
301011030	Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.
301011031	
301011032	
301011033	
301011034	
301011035	
301011036	
301011037	
301011038	
301011039	
301011040	Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold...
301011041	
301011042	
301011043	
301011044	
301011045	
301011046	
301011047	
301011048	
301011049	
301011050	You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity.
301012000	Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless.
301012001	
301012002	
301012003	
301012004	
301012005	
301012006	
301012007	
301012008	
301012009	
301012010	Me. Varré. Take care to listen.
301012011	
301012012	
301012013	
301012014	
301012015	
301012016	
301012017	
301012018	
301012019	
301012020	Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.
301012021	
301012022	
301012023	
301012024	
301012025	
301012026	
301012027	
301012028	
301012029	
301012030	You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.
301012031	
301012032	
301012033	
301012034	
301012035	
301012036	
301012037	
301012038	
301012039	
301012040	That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.
301012041	
301012042	
301012043	
301012044	
301012045	
301012046	
301012047	
301012048	
301012049	
301012050	Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers.
301012051	
301012052	
301012053	
301012054	
301012055	
301012056	
301012057	
301012058	
301012059	
301012060	It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.
301012061	
301012062	
301012063	
301012064	
301012065	
301012066	
301012067	
301012068	
301012069	
301012070	Even if it leads you to your grave.
301013000	Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.
301013001	
301013002	
301013003	
301013004	
301013005	
301013006	
301013007	
301013008	
301013009	
301013010	To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.
301013011	
301013012	
301013013	
301013014	
301013015	
301013016	
301013017	
301013018	
301013019	
301013020	The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.
301014000	It's time you set off, I should think.
301014001	
301014002	
301014003	
301014004	
301014005	
301014006	
301014007	
301014008	
301014009	
301014010	To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.
301014011	
301014012	
301014013	
301014014	
301014015	
301014016	
301014017	
301014018	
301014019	
301014020	If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.
301020000	Ohh, well done, well done indeed.
301020001	
301020002	
301020003	
301020004	
301020005	
301020006	
301020007	
301020008	
301020009	
301020010	You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.
301020011	
301020012	
301020013	
301020014	
301020015	
301020016	
301020017	
301020018	
301020019	
301020020	And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold… My sincerest congratulations.
301020021	
301020022	
301020023	
301020024	
301020025	
301020026	
301020027	
301020028	
301020029	
301020030	But, how did you find the Roundtable?
301020031	
301020032	
301020033	
301020034	
301020035	
301020036	
301020037	
301020038	
301020039	
301020040	Oh, you don't have to say it.
301020041	
301020042	
301020043	
301020044	
301020045	
301020046	
301020047	
301020048	
301020049	
301020050	Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.
301020051	
301020052	
301020053	
301020054	
301020055	
301020056	
301020057	
301020058	
301020059	
301020060	I fear you've been terribly disappointed.
301020061	
301020062	
301020063	
301020064	
301020065	
301020066	
301020067	
301020068	
301020069	
301020070	I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks.
301020071	
301020072	
301020073	
301020074	
301020075	
301020076	
301020077	
301020078	
301020079	
301020080	Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak.
301021000	Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.
301021001	
301021002	
301021003	
301021004	
301021005	
301021006	
301021007	
301021008	
301021009	
301021010	To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience...
301021011	
301021012	
301021013	
301021014	
301021015	
301021016	
301021017	
301021018	
301021019	
301021020	...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
301021021	
301021022	
301021023	
301021024	
301021025	
301021026	
301021027	
301021028	
301021029	
301021030	They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.
301021031	
301021032	
301021033	
301021034	
301021035	
301021036	
301021037	
301021038	
301021039	
301021040	Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.
301022000	Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.
301022001	
301022002	
301022003	
301022004	
301022005	
301022006	
301022007	
301022008	
301022009	
301022010	Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune.
301022011	
301022012	
301022013	
301022014	
301022015	
301022016	
301022017	
301022018	
301022019	
301022020	Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft...
301022021	
301022022	
301022023	
301022024	
301022025	
301022026	
301022027	
301022028	
301022029	
301022030	So. Prepare for the worst.
301023000	...
301023001	
301023002	
301023003	
301023004	
301023005	
301023006	
301023007	
301023008	
301023009	
301023010	Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well.
301023011	
301023012	
301023013	
301023014	
301023015	
301023016	
301023017	
301023018	
301023019	
301023020	Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided.
301023021	
301023022	
301023023	
301023024	
301023025	
301023026	
301023027	
301023028	
301023029	
301023030	But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways,
301023031	
301023032	
301023033	
301023034	
301023035	
301023036	
301023037	
301023038	
301023039	
301023040	I'm always willing to hear you out.
301024000	Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper?
301025000	What's the matter?
301025001	
301025002	
301025003	
301025004	
301025005	
301025006	
301025007	
301025008	
301025009	
301025010	Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold?
301025011	
301025012	
301025013	
301025014	
301025015	
301025016	
301025017	
301025018	
301025019	
301025020	Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil,
301025021	
301025022	
301025023	
301025024	
301025025	
301025026	
301025027	
301025028	
301025029	
301025030	for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience.
301025031	
301025032	
301025033	
301025034	
301025035	
301025036	
301025037	
301025038	
301025039	
301025040	With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
301026000	Ohh, well done, well done indeed.
301026001	
301026002	
301026003	
301026004	
301026005	
301026006	
301026007	
301026008	
301026009	
301026010	You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune.
301026011	
301026012	
301026013	
301026014	
301026015	
301026016	
301026017	
301026018	
301026019	
301026020	You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune.
301026021	
301026022	
301026023	
301026024	
301026025	
301026026	
301026027	
301026028	
301026029	
301026030	My congratulations.
301026031	
301026032	
301026033	
301026034	
301026035	
301026036	
301026037	
301026038	
301026039	
301026040	Now, visit the Roundtable Hold.
301026041	
301026042	
301026043	
301026044	
301026045	
301026046	
301026047	
301026048	
301026049	
301026050	For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
301027000	Go to the Roundtable Hold.
301027001	
301027002	
301027003	
301027004	
301027005	
301027006	
301027007	
301027008	
301027009	
301027010	For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
301030000	Ah, there you are.
301030001	
301030002	
301030003	
301030004	
301030005	
301030006	
301030007	
301030008	
301030009	
301030010	You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.
301030011	
301030012	
301030013	
301030014	
301030015	
301030016	
301030017	
301030018	
301030019	
301030020	You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.
301030021	
301030022	
301030023	
301030024	
301030025	
301030026	
301030027	
301030028	
301030029	
301030030	What was your impression?
301031000	Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well.
301031001	
301031002	
301031003	
301031004	
301031005	
301031006	
301031007	
301031008	
301031009	
301031010	My doubts had been piling up, you see.
301031011	
301031012	
301031013	
301031014	
301031015	
301031016	
301031017	
301031018	
301031019	
301031020	...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted.
301031021	
301031022	
301031023	
301031024	
301031025	
301031026	
301031027	
301031028	
301031029	
301031030	Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions.
301031031	
301031032	
301031033	
301031034	
301031035	
301031036	
301031037	
301031038	
301031039	
301031040	I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed.
301031041	
301031042	
301031043	
301031044	
301031045	
301031046	
301031047	
301031048	
301031049	
301031050	Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind.
301031051	
301031052	
301031053	
301031054	
301031055	
301031056	
301031057	
301031058	
301031059	
301031060	That's the part that irks the most.
301032000	Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise.
301033000	A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers.
301033001	
301033002	
301033003	
301033004	
301033005	
301033006	
301033007	
301033008	
301033009	
301033010	Give it a try, won't you?
301033011	
301033012	
301033013	
301033014	
301033015	
301033016	
301033017	
301033018	
301033019	
301033020	And if it please you, may we meet again.
301033021	
301033022	
301033023	
301033024	
301033025	
301033026	
301033027	
301033028	
301033029	
301033030	I've high hopes for you. My lambkin.
301034000	You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be.
301034001	
301034002	
301034003	
301034004	
301034005	
301034006	
301034007	
301034008	
301034009	
301034010	You may go, then. My work here is done.
301034011	
301034012	
301034013	
301034014	
301034015	
301034016	
301034017	
301034018	
301034019	
301034020	May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you.
301035000	Oh? Is something wrong?
301036000	Be sure to try that finger I gave you.
301036001	
301036002	
301036003	
301036004	
301036005	
301036006	
301036007	
301036008	
301036009	
301036010	There's no reason to dither.
301036011	
301036012	
301036013	
301036014	
301036015	
301036016	
301036017	
301036018	
301036019	
301036020	The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world?
301036021	
301036022	
301036023	
301036024	
301036025	
301036026	
301036027	
301036028	
301036029	
301036030	Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them.
301037000	Be sure to try that finger I gave you.
301037001	
301037002	
301037003	
301037004	
301037005	
301037006	
301037007	
301037008	
301037009	
301037010	I'm quite certain that you'll take to it.
301050000	Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here.
301050001	
301050002	
301050003	
301050004	
301050005	
301050006	
301050007	
301050008	
301050009	
301050010	I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift.
301050011	
301050012	
301050013	
301050014	
301050015	
301050016	
301050017	
301050018	
301050019	
301050020	Mmm, I knew it from the very start.
301050021	
301050022	
301050023	
301050024	
301050025	
301050026	
301050027	
301050028	
301050029	
301050030	You have a taste for noble blood.
301050031	
301050032	
301050033	
301050034	
301050035	
301050036	
301050037	
301050038	
301050039	
301050040	...
301050041	
301050042	
301050043	
301050044	
301050045	
301050046	
301050047	
301050048	
301050049	
301050050	I wish to anoint you a proper inductee.
301050051	
301050052	
301050053	
301050054	
301050055	
301050056	
301050057	
301050058	
301050059	
301050060	A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty.
301050061	
301050062	
301050063	
301050064	
301050065	
301050066	
301050067	
301050068	
301050069	
301050070	Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love.
301050071	
301050072	
301050073	
301050074	
301050075	
301050076	
301050077	
301050078	
301050079	
301050080	So, what do you say, my lambkin?
301051000	Mm, yes, who would have it any other way?
301051001	
301051002	
301051003	
301051004	
301051005	
301051006	
301051007	
301051008	
301051009	
301051010	Now, take this.
301051011	
301051012	
301051013	
301051014	
301051015	
301051016	
301051017	
301051018	
301051019	
301051020	For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood.
301051021	
301051022	
301051023	
301051024	
301051025	
301051026	
301051027	
301051028	
301051029	
301051030	Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
301051031	
301051032	
301051033	
301051034	
301051035	
301051036	
301051037	
301051038	
301051039	
301051040	But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.
301052000	Oh my, perhaps you misheard me.
301052001	
301052002	
301052003	
301052004	
301052005	
301052006	
301052007	
301052008	
301052009	
301052010	Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two.
301052011	
301052012	
301052013	
301052014	
301052015	
301052016	
301052017	
301052018	
301052019	
301052020	For your ears to clear out.
301053000	Oh, it's you.
301053001	
301053002	
301053003	
301053004	
301053005	
301053006	
301053007	
301053008	
301053009	
301053010	Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply.
301054000	Ahh, my lambkin.
301054001	
301054002	
301054003	
301054004	
301054005	
301054006	
301054007	
301054008	
301054009	
301054010	You've completed your final trial.
301054011	
301054012	
301054013	
301054014	
301054015	
301054016	
301054017	
301054018	
301054019	
301054020	And with this, you are a formal inductee.
301054021	
301054022	
301054023	
301054024	
301054025	
301054026	
301054027	
301054028	
301054029	
301054030	A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty.
301054031	
301054032	
301054033	
301054034	
301054035	
301054036	
301054037	
301054038	
301054039	
301054040	Now, give me your finger.
301054041	
301054042	
301054043	
301054044	
301054045	
301054046	
301054047	
301054048	
301054049	
301054050	This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you.
301054051	
301054052	
301054053	
301054054	
301054055	
301054056	
301054057	
301054058	
301054059	
301054060	Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.
301054061	
301054062	
301054063	
301054064	
301054065	
301054066	
301054067	
301054068	
301054069	
301054070	Never forget that feeling of agony.
301054071	
301054072	
301054073	
301054074	
301054075	
301054076	
301054077	
301054078	
301054079	
301054080	For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us.
301054081	
301054082	
301054083	
301054084	
301054085	
301054086	
301054087	
301054088	
301054089	
301054090	Ha ha ha...
301054091	
301054092	
301054093	
301054094	
301054095	
301054096	
301054097	
301054098	
301054099	
301054100	You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin.
301055000	Oh, another thing. You should have this.
301056000	A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty.
301056001	
301056002	
301056003	
301056004	
301056005	
301056006	
301056007	
301056008	
301056009	
301056010	With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg.
301056011	
301056012	
301056013	
301056014	
301056015	
301056016	
301056017	
301056018	
301056019	
301056020	I've gone out of my way to provide one to you.
301056021	
301056022	
301056023	
301056024	
301056025	
301056026	
301056027	
301056028	
301056029	
301056030	But you mustn't use it just yet.
301056031	
301056032	
301056033	
301056034	
301056035	
301056036	
301056037	
301056038	
301056039	
301056040	The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences.
301056041	
301056042	
301056043	
301056044	
301056045	
301056046	
301056047	
301056048	
301056049	
301056050	Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity.
301056051	
301056052	
301056053	
301056054	
301056055	
301056056	
301056057	
301056058	
301056059	
301056060	We must endure a little longer.
301057000	Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient.
301057001	
301057002	
301057003	
301057004	
301057005	
301057006	
301057007	
301057008	
301057009	
301057010	One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love.
301057011	
301057012	
301057013	
301057014	
301057015	
301057016	
301057017	
301057018	
301057019	
301057020	Right, my lambkin?
301057021	
301057022	
301057023	
301057024	
301057025	
301057026	
301057027	
301057028	
301057029	
301057030	Ha ha ha...
301058000	The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden.
301058001	
301058002	
301058003	
301058004	
301058005	
301058006	
301058007	
301058008	
301058009	
301058010	The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all.
301080000	What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here?
301080001	
301080002	
301080003	
301080004	
301080005	
301080006	
301080007	
301080008	
301080009	
301080010	Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg?
301080011	
301080012	
301080013	
301080014	
301080015	
301080016	
301080017	
301080018	
301080019	
301080020	I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this.
301080021	
301080022	
301080023	
301080024	
301080025	
301080026	
301080027	
301080028	
301080029	
301080030	Before you die in obscurity.
301081000	You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty?
301081001	
301081002	
301081003	
301081004	
301081005	
301081006	
301081007	
301081008	
301081009	
301081010	I am pained, to the very depths of my being.
301081011	
301081012	
301081013	
301081014	
301081015	
301081016	
301081017	
301081018	
301081019	
301081020	I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin.
301081021	
301081022	
301081023	
301081024	
301081025	
301081026	
301081027	
301081028	
301081029	
301081030	Enjoy your miserable death.
301082000	How dare you trouble Luminary Mohg's passions.
301082001	
301082002	
301082003	
301082004	
301082005	
301082006	
301082007	
301082008	
301082009	
301082010	You vulgar churl.
301083000	I made a grave error.
301084000	Why must I be...
301084001	
301084002	
301084003	
301084004	
301084005	
301084006	
301084007	
301084008	
301084009	
301084010	Disgraced by this lowborn...
301085000	O...Luminary...Mohg...
301085001	
301085002	
301085003	
301085004	
301085005	
301085006	
301085007	
301085008	
301085009	
301085010	Please grant...the strength...you promised...
301085011	
301085012	
301085013	
301085014	
301085015	
301085016	
301085017	
301085018	
301085019	
301085020	I have given...everything...
301085021	
301085022	
301085023	
301085024	
301085025	
301085026	
301085027	
301085028	
301085029	
301085030	Please...my lord...
301086000	Please, answer me...Luminary...Mohg.
301086001	
301086002	
301086003	
301086004

301086007	
301086008	
301086009	
301086010	...
301086011	
301086012	
301086013	
301086014	
301086015	
301086016	
301086017	
301086018	
301086019	
301086020	A-ahh...
301086021	
301086022	
301086023	
301086024	
301086025	
301086026	
301086027	
301086028	
301086029	
301086030	Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!
301086031	
301086032	
301086033	
301086034	
301086035	
301086036	
301086037	
301086038	
301086039	
301086040	<groan>
301086041	
301086042	
301086043	
301086044	
301086045	
301086046	
301086047	
301086048	
301086049	
301086050	...
301800000	Oh?
301801000	Do you even comprehend?
301801001	
301801002	
301801003	
301801004	
301801005	
301801006	
301801007	
301801008	
301801009	
301801010	The gravity of this choice.
301802000	Very well.
301802001	
301802002	
301802003	
301802004	
301802005	
301802006	
301802007	
301802008	
301802009	
301802010	If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart,
301802011	
301802012	
301802013	
301802014	
301802015	
301802016	
301802017	
301802018	
301802019	
301802020	then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order!
301803000	You disappoint me.
301803001	
301803002	
301803003	
301803004	
301803005	
301803006	
301803007	
301803008	
301803009	
301803010	Perhaps noble blood is too rich for the maidenless.
301803011	
301803012	
301803013	
301803014	
301803015	
301803016	
301803017	
301803018	
301803019	
301803020	Well, no sense in sparing your life now.
301804000	You were a maidenless upstart to begin with.
301804001	
301804002	
301804003	
301804004	
301804005	
301804006	
301804007	
301804008	
301804009	
301804010	You will die nameless, without ceremony.
301805000	Oh dear, a pity it's come to this, my lambkin.
301805001	
301805002	
301805003	
301805004	
301805005	
301805006	
301805007	
301805008	
301805009	
301805010	How does it feel to die a failure?
301805011	
301805012	
301805013	
301805014	
301805015	
301805016	
301805017	
301805018	
301805019	
301805020	Materials of quality are so hard to find, these days...
301806000	You maidenless runt...
301806001	
301806002	
301806003	
301806004	
301806005	
301806006	
301806007	
301806008	
301806009	
301806010	Who do you think I am?
301806011	
301806012	
301806013	
301806014	
301806015

301806017	
301806018	
301806019	
301806020	<groan>
301807000	Luminary Mohg...
301807001	
301807002	
301807003	
301807004	
301807005	
301807006	
301807007	
301807008	
301807009	
301807010	Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!
301807011	
301807012	
301807013	
301807014	
301807015

301900005	
301900006	
301900007	
301900008	
301900009	
301900010	 
301900011	
301900012	
301900013	
301900014	
301900015	
301900016	
301900017	
301900018	
301900019	
301900020	 
302001000	You there.
302001001	
302001002	
302001003	
302001004	
302001005	
302001006	
302001007	
302001008	
302001009	
302001010	Come over here, would you?
302002000	You're Tarnished, aren't you?
302002001	
302002002	
302002003	
302002004	
302002005	
302002006	
302002007	
302002008	
302002009	
302002010	I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.
302002011	
302002012	
302002013	
302002014	
302002015	
302002016	
302002017	
302002018	
302002019	
302002020	It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.
302002021	
302002022	
302002023	
302002024	
302002025	
302002026	
302002027	
302002028	
302002029	
302002030	Try the opening right here.
302002031	
302002032	
302002033	
302002034	
302002035	
302002036	
302002037	
302002038	
302002039	
302002040	The guards don't know about it.
302002041	
302002042	
302002043	
302002044	
302002045	
302002046	
302002047	
302002048	
302002049	
302002050	You'll breach the castle undetected.
302003000	Yes, that's the spirit.
302003001	
302003002	
302003003	
302003004	
302003005	
302003006	
302003007	
302003008	
302003009	
302003010	...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.
302003011	
302003012	
302003013	
302003014	
302003015	
302003016	
302003017	
302003018	
302003019	
302003020	I pray for your success.
302004000	Fair enough, you certainly don't have to trust me.
302004001	
302004002	
302004003	
302004004	
302004005	
302004006	
302004007	
302004008	
302004009	
302004010	Well, If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.
302004011	
302004012	
302004013	
302004014	
302004015	
302004016	
302004017	
302004018	
302004019	
302004020	But of course, I'd advise against it.
302005000	Use that opening to breach the castle.
302005001	
302005002	
302005003	
302005004	
302005005	
302005006	
302005007	
302005008	
302005009	
302005010	The guards haven't a clue about it.
302005011	
302005012	
302005013	
302005014	
302005015	
302005016	
302005017	
302005018	
302005019	
302005020	You'll slip right inside undetected.
302006000	Of course. I understand.
302006001	
302006002	
302006003	
302006004	
302006005	
302006006	
302006007	
302006008	
302006009	
302006010	When you approach the gates, I'll signal them to open.
302006011	
302006012	
302006013	
302006014	
302006015	
302006016	
302006017	
302006018	
302006019	
302006020	It's only your neck on the line, after all.
302007000	The gates! Open the gates!
302008000	...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.
302008001	
302008002	
302008003	
302008004	
302008005	
302008006	
302008007	
302008008	
302008009	
302008010	I pray for your success.
302009000	The gates are open. Do as you like.
302009001	
302009002	
302009003	
302009004	
302009005	
302009006	
302009007	
302009008	
302009009	
302009010	It's only your neck on the line, after all.
302020000	Oh, oh, you...
302020001	
302020002	
302020003	
302020004	
302020005	
302020006	
302020007	
302020008	
302020009	
302020010	Oh, great, I'm glad you're here.
302020011	
302020012	
302020013	
302020014	
302020015	
302020016	
302020017	
302020018	
302020019	
302020020	Just a small reward, I was saving it for you.
302020021	
302020022	
302020023	
302020024	
302020025	
302020026	
302020027	
302020028	
302020029	
302020030	Please, it's all yours.
302021000	Good, now let's be on our way, shall we?
302021001	
302021002	
302021003	
302021004	
302021005

302021010	Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.
302022000	Hop along, will you?
302022001	
302022002	
302022003	
302022004	
302022005	
302022006	
302022007	
302022008	
302022009	
302022010	What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?
302025000	Rubbish...
302025001	
302025002	
302025003	
302025004	
302025005	
302025006	
302025007	
302025008	
302025009	
302025010	Another one...another one all skin and bones.
302025011	
302025012	
302025013	
302025014	
302025015	
302025016	
302025017	
302025018	
302025019	
302025020	...Worse than a petty squire...
302025021	
302025022	
302025023	
302025024	
302025025	
302025026	
302025027	
302025028	
302025029	
302025030	...Ahh, not a muscle on this one either...
302026000	Oh, you...
302026001	
302026002	
302026003	
302026004	
302026005	
302026006	
302026007	
302026008	
302026009	
302026010	For god's sake, don't scare me like that!
302026011	
302026012	
302026013	
302026014	
302026015	
302026016	
302026017	
302026018	
302026019	
302026020	...
302026021	
302026022	
302026023	
302026024	
302026025	
302026026	
302026027	
302026028	
302026029	
302026030	What, oh, just clearing out some corpses.
302026031	
302026032	
302026033	
302026034	
302026035	
302026036	
302026037	
302026038	
302026039	
302026040	Can't just leave them about, you know, they'll start to pong, eh.
302027000	Oh, hello. No, don't you mind me for a minute.
302027001	
302027002	
302027003	
302027004	
302027005	
302027006	
302027007	
302027008	
302027009	
302027010	It's my job to keep the grounds clean.
302028000	 
302040000	Oh, hello... Glad to see you safe.
302040001	
302040002	
302040003	
302040004	
302040005	
302040006	
302040007	
302040008	
302040009	
302040010	I've come into some fine goods.
302040011	
302040012	
302040013	
302040014	
302040015	
302040016	
302040017	
302040018	
302040019	
302040020	Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them.
302040021	
302040022	
302040023	
302040024	
302040025	
302040026	
302040027	
302040028	
302040029	
302040030	Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?
302041000	Oh, hello, anything you'd care to purchase?
302045000	Fare thee well.
302045001	
302045002	
302045003	
302045004	
302045005	
302045006	
302045007	
302045008	
302045009	
302045010	I pray for your success.
302050000	What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone.
302050001	
302050002	
302050003	
302050004	
302050005	
302050006	
302050007	
302050008	
302050009	
302050010	Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you?
302050011	
302050012	
302050013	
302050014	
302050015	
302050016	
302050017	
302050018	
302050019	
302050020	Look down, on me, would you?
302050021	
302050022	
302050023	
302050024	
302050025	
302050026	
302050027	
302050028	
302050029	
302050030	Godrick? You filthy slug.
302050031	
302050032	
302050033	
302050034	
302050035	
302050036	
302050037	
302050038	
302050039	
302050040	Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath!
302051000	Oh...hello there.
302051001	
302051002	
302051003	
302051004	
302051005	
302051006	
302051007	
302051008	
302051009	
302051010	This weasel was... Godrick was always looking down on me.
302051011	
302051012	
302051013	
302051014	
302051015	
302051016	
302051017	
302051018	
302051019	
302051020	He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you.
302051021	
302051022	
302051023	
302051024	
302051025	
302051026	
302051027	
302051028	
302051029	
302051030	I tell you though, what goes around comes around.
302051031	
302051032	
302051033	
302051034	
302051035	
302051036	
302051037	
302051038	
302051039	
302051040	He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh.
302051041	
302051042	
302051043	
302051044	
302051045	
302051046	
302051047	
302051048	
302051049	
302051050	He he he he he...
302052000	Now, I suppose I'm free.
302052001	
302052002	
302052003	
302052004	
302052005	
302052006	
302052007	
302052008	
302052009	
302052010	I can do whatever takes my fancy...
302052011	
302052012	
302052013	
302052014	
302052015	
302052016	
302052017	
302052018	
302052019	
302052020	Can't I, mate?
302060000	You giving that to me?
302060001	
302060002	
302060003	
302060004	
302060005	
302060006	
302060007	
302060008	
302060009	
302060010	...
302060011	
302060012	
302060013	
302060014	
302060015	
302060016	
302060017	
302060018	
302060019	
302060020	Well, I suppose I did save your life, in a way.
302060021	
302060022	
302060023	
302060024	
302060025	
302060026	
302060027	
302060028	
302060029	
302060030	I'll gladly take it off your hands. Be rude not to, eh!
302060031	
302060032	
302060033	
302060034	
302060035	
302060036	
302060037	
302060038	
302060039	
302060040	Mmm, you Tarnished are alright by me.
302060041	
302060042	
302060043	
302060044	
302060045	
302060046	
302060047	
302060048	
302060049	
302060050	The sweet ones like you, anyway.
302061000	...
302070000	Ah, you, is it?
302070001	
302070002	
302070003	
302070004	
302070005	
302070006	
302070007	
302070008	
302070009	
302070010	Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.
302070011	
302070012	
302070013	
302070014	
302070015	
302070016	
302070017	
302070018	
302070019	
302070020	As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.
302070021	
302070022	
302070023	
302070024	
302070025	
302070026	
302070027	
302070028	
302070029	
302070030	Freedom? Wasn't worth squat.
302070031	
302070032	
302070033	
302070034	
302070035	
302070036	
302070037	
302070038	
302070039	
302070040	B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...
302070041	
302070042	
302070043	
302070044	
302070045	
302070046	
302070047	
302070048	
302070049	
302070050	Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance...
302071000	Still, I have the Lady's trust.
302071001	
302071002	
302071003	
302071004	
302071005	
302071006	
302071007	
302071008	
302071009	
302071010	...So I can loot all the corpses I like.
302071011	
302071012	
302071013	
302071014	
302071015	
302071016	
302071017	
302071018	
302071019	
302071020	I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy.
302072000	Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.
302072001	
302072002	
302072003	
302072004	
302072005	
302072006	
302072007	
302072008	
302072009	
302072010	Well then, what are you after?
302800000	Ouch!
302801000	Oi, what're you doing?
302801001	
302801002	
302801003	
302801004	
302801005	
302801006	
302801007	
302801008	
302801009	
302801010	Stop that!
302802000	Blast, what's it to you!
302802001	
302802002	
302802003	
302802004	
302802005	
302802006	
302802007	
302802008	
302802009	
302802010	Step back, you wretched Tarnished!
302803000	Finally given up the ghost, eh...
302803001	
302803002	
302803003	
302803004	
302803005	
302803006	
302803007	
302803008	
302803009	
302803010	Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you...
302804000	Hah! Do you feel it?
302804001	
302804002	
302804003	
302804004	
302804005	
302804006	
302804007	
302804008	
302804009	
302804010	Do you feel my bloody wrath?
302805000	Damn it all. Why is it always me...
302805001	
302805002	
302805003	
302805004	
302805005	
302805006	
302805007	
302805008	
302805009	
302805010	What did I do to deserve...
302806000	But...I'm free...
302806001	
302806002	
302806003	
302806004	
302806005	
302806006	
302806007	
302806008	
302806009	
302806010	I can do...what I like...
302900000	 
302900001	
302900002	
302900003	
302900004	
302900005	
302900006	
302900007	
302900008	
302900009	
302900010	 
302900011	
302900012	
302900013	
302900014	
302900015	
302900016	
302900017	
302900018	
302900019	
302900020	 
303001000	Good Lord! Good God of Vengeance!
303001001	
303001002	
303001003	
303001004	
303001005	
303001006	
303001007	
303001008	
303001009	
303001010	Till grudges soak the lands!
303002000	Oh...
303002001	
303002002	
303002003	
303002004	
303002005	
303002006	
303002007	
303002008	
303002009	
303002010	I see, you're Tarnished.
303002011	
303002012	
303002013	
303002014	
303002015	
303002016	
303002017	
303002018	
303002019	
303002020	I am Guilbert. A Redeemer of vengeance. In all its forms.
303003000	By the way...
303003001	
303003002	
303003003	
303003004	
303003005	
303003006	
303003007	
303003008	
303003009	
303003010	Have you heard of the crucible knights?
303003011	
303003012	
303003013	
303003014	
303003015	
303003016	
303003017	
303003018	
303003019	
303003020	There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him.
303003021	
303003022	
303003023	
303003024	
303003025	
303003026	
303003027	
303003028	
303003029	
303003030	He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him.
303003031	
303003032	
303003033	
303003034	
303003035	
303003036	
303003037	
303003038	
303003039	
303003040	The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance.
303003041	
303003042	
303003043	
303003044	
303003045	
303003046	
303003047	
303003048	
303003049	
303003050	...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it...
303004000	These fellows?
303004001	
303004002	
303004003	
303004004	
303004005

303004010	Who knows, just some lads who did someone wrong.
303004011	
303004012	
303004013	
303004014	
303004015	
303004016	
303004017	
303004018	
303004019	
303004020	They got what was coming, nothing more.
303004021	
303004022	
303004023	
303004024	
303004025	
303004026	
303004027	
303004028	
303004029	
303004030	If you're intent on revenge, pray to the God of Vengeance.
303004031	
303004032	
303004033	
303004034	
303004035	
303004036	
303004037	
303004038	
303004039	
303004040	You'll have yourself a corpse in no time.
303005000	You're Tarnished. Then you're here to fight, aren't you?
303005001	
303005002	
303005003	
303005004	
303005005	
303005006	
303005007	
303005008	
303005009	
303005010	For the Elden Ring.
303005011	
303005012	
303005013	
303005014	
303005015	
303005016	
303005017	
303005018	
303005019	
303005020	Well, there's something you ought to know.
303005021	
303005022	
303005023	
303005024	
303005025	
303005026	
303005027	
303005028	
303005029	
303005030	There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil.
303005031	
303005032	
303005033	
303005034	
303005035	
303005036	
303005037	
303005038	
303005039	
303005040	He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished.
303005041	
303005042	
303005043	
303005044	
303005045	
303005046	
303005047	
303005048	
303005049	
303005050	He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods.
303005051	
303005052	
303005053	
303005054	
303005055	
303005056	
303005057	
303005058	
303005059	
303005060	...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance...
303006000	In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should.
303006001	
303006002	
303006003	
303006004	
303006005	
303006006	
303006007	
303006008	
303006009	
303006010	They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance.
303006011	
303006012	
303006013	
303006014	
303006015	
303006016	
303006017	
303006018	
303006019	
303006020	That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves.
303006021	
303006022	
303006023	
303006024	
303006025	
303006026	
303006027	
303006028	
303006029	
303006030	Like someone did for me, when I...when I was but a tyke.
303010000	Oh, there you are...
303010001	
303010002	
303010003	
303010004	
303010005	
303010006	
303010007	
303010008	
303010009	
303010010	It must have been a dream. Strange.
303010011	
303010012	
303010013	
303010014	
303010015	
303010016	
303010017	
303010018	
303010019	
303010020	I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible.
303010021	
303010022	
303010023	
303010024	
303010025	
303010026	
303010027	
303010028	
303010029	
303010030	It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance.
303010031	
303010032	
303010033	
303010034	
303010035	
303010036	
303010037	
303010038	
303010039	
303010040	Heh...
303010041	
303010042	
303010043	
303010044	
303010045	
303010046	
303010047	
303010048	
303010049	
303010050	Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well...
303010520	I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.
303011000	Ah, you...
303011001	
303011002	
303011003	
303011004	
303011005	
303011006	
303011007	
303011008	
303011009	
303011010	Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible?
303011011	
303011012	
303011013	
303011014	
303011015	
303011016	
303011017	
303011018	
303011019	
303011020	I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle.
303011021	
303011022	
303011023	
303011024	
303011025	
303011026	
303011027	
303011028	
303011029	
303011030	Heh...
303011031	
303011032	
303011033	
303011034	
303011035	
303011036	
303011037	
303011038	
303011039	
303011040	Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too...
303011510	Did you defeat Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.
303013000	Alright, then.
303013001	
303013002	
303013003	
303013004	
303013005	
303013006	
303013007	
303013008	
303013009	
303013010	I'm off to Stormveil Castle.
303013011	
303013012	
303013013	
303013014	
303013015	
303013016	
303013017	
303013018	
303013019	
303013020	Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting...
303013021	
303013022	
303013023	
303013024	
303013025	
303013026	
303013027	
303013028	
303013029	
303013030	Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood.
303013031	
303013032	
303013033	
303013034	
303013035	
303013036	
303013037	
303013038	
303013039	
303013040	A demigod, yes, he may be...
303013041	
303013042	
303013043	
303013044	
303013045	
303013046	
303013047	
303013048	
303013049	
303013050	But no one escapes a Redeemer.
303014000	I was thinking...
303014001	
303014002	
303014003	
303014004	
303014005	
303014006	
303014007	
303014008	
303014009	
303014010	Godrick must have an idea.
303014011	
303014012	
303014013	
303014014	
303014015	
303014016	
303014017	
303014018	
303014019	
303014020	About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath.
303014021	
303014022	
303014023	
303014024	
303014025	
303014026	
303014027	
303014028	
303014029	
303014030	...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do...
303014510	Godrick must know.
303014920	That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound.
303015000	Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red...
303015001	
303015002	
303015003	
303015004	
303015005	
303015006	
303015007	
303015008	
303015009	
303015010	Master Radahn, is this how it feels to ferment with vengeance?
303015011	
303015012	
303015013	
303015014	
303015015	
303015016	
303015017	
303015018	
303015019	
303015020	I can hardly keep from trembling...
303900000	Well, well, you've made yourself a target of vengeance.
303900001	
303900002	
303900003	
303900004	
303900005	
303900006	
303900007	
303900008	
303900009	
303900010	Perhaps this, too, was meant to be.
303900011	
303900012	
303900013	
303900014	
303900015	
303900016	
303900017	
303900018	
303900019	
303900020	Prepare to become an offering.
303900021	
303900022	
303900023	
303900024	
303900025	
303900026	
303900027	
303900028	
303900029	
303900030	Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.
303901000	Hello there, I don't believe we've met.
303901001	
303901002	
303901003	
303901004	
303901005	
303901006	
303901007	
303901008	
303901009	
303901010	I'm afraid you've made yourself the object of somebody's ire.
303901011	
303901012	
303901013	
303901014	
303901015	
303901016	
303901017	
303901018	
303901019	
303901020	As a Redeemer, I'm bound to exact revenge.
303901021	
303901022	
303901023	
303901024	
303901025	
303901026	
303901027	
303901028	
303901029	
303901030	Prepare to become an offering.
303901031	
303901032	
303901033	
303901034	
303901035	
303901036	
303901037	
303901038	
303901039	
303901040	Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.
303902000	Whoah, what're you playing at? (OKテイク, v303902000_ALT_3)\nWhat're you playing at?
303903000	...
303903001	
303903002	
303903003	
303903004	
303903005	
303903006	
303903007	
303903008	
303903009	
303903010	This is a little awkward.
303903011	
303903012	
303903013	
303903014	
303903015	
303903016	
303903017	
303903018	
303903019	
303903020	There's no revenge to be had in this killing.
303904000	Not too sharp, are you?
303904001	
303904002	
303904003	
303904004	
303904005	
303904006	
303904007	
303904008	
303904009	
303904010	If you want to die, ask someone else.
303905000	 
303905100	 
303905200	 
303906000	Let it be known.
303906001	
303906002	
303906003	
303906004	
303906005	
303906006	
303906007	
303906008	
303906009	
303906010	Wherever vengeance must be had, a Redeemer there will be...
303907000	Oh, my Lord. Good God of Vengeance!
303907001	
303907002	
303907003	
303907004	
303907005	
303907006	
303907007	
303907008	
303907009	
303907010	Till grudges soak the lands...
303908000	Don't you see now?
303908001	
303908002	
303908003	
303908004	
303908005	
303908006	
303908007	
303908008	
303908009	
303908010	There is no escape from a Redeemer.
303909000	Death ought to be earned.
303909001	
303909002	
303909003	
303909004	
303909005	
303909006	
303909007	
303909008	
303909009	
303909010	What am I to make of this?
303910000	Didn't I tell you before?
303910001	
303910002	
303910003	
303910004	
303910005	
303910006	
303910007	
303910008	
303910009	
303910010	No one escapes a Redeemer.
303910011	
303910012	
303910013	
303910014	
303910015	
303910016	
303910017	
303910018	
303910019	
303910020	Prepare to become an offering, once and for all.
303910021	
303910022	
303910023	
303910024	
303910025	
303910026	
303910027	
303910028	
303910029	
303910030	Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.
307001000	I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling.
307001001	I see... You must be Ranni's new girl.
307001002	
307001003	
307001004	
307001005	
307001006	
307001007	
307001008	
307001009	
307001010	Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.
307001011	
307001012	
307001013	
307001014	
307001015	
307001016	
307001017	
307001018	
307001019	
307001020	I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.
307001021	
307001022	
307001023	
307001024	
307001025	
307001026	
307001027	
307001028	
307001029	
307001030	I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,
307001031	
307001032	
307001033	
307001034	
307001035	
307001036	
307001037	
307001038	
307001039	
307001040	but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,
307001041	
307001042	
307001043	
307001044	
307001045	
307001046	
307001047	
307001048	
307001049	
307001050	I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.
307002000	I reside...in another tower, close by.
307002001	
307002002	
307002003	
307002004	
307002005	
307002006	
307002007	
307002008	
307002009	
307002010	Come and pay me a visit...
307002011	
307002012	
307002013	
307002014	
307002015	
307002016	
307002017	
307002018	
307002019	
307002020	Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.
307002021	
307002022	
307002023	
307002024	
307002025	
307002026	
307002027	
307002028	
307002029	
307002030	If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.
307002031	
307002032	
307002033	
307002034	
307002035	
307002036	
307002037	
307002038	
307002039	
307002040	But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?
307010000	Well, well. You took me at my word.
307010001	
307010002	
307010003	
307010004	
307010005	
307010006	
307010007	
307010008	
307010009	
307010010	Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...
307010011	
307010012	
307010013	
307010014	
307010015	
307010016	
307010017	
307010018	
307010019	
307010020	Hmm, I suppose you're here now.
307010021	
307010022	
307010023	
307010024	
307010025	
307010026	
307010027	
307010028	
307010029	
307010030	Perhaps I'll give you something to do.
307010031	
307010032	
307010033	
307010034	
307010035	
307010036	
307010037	
307010038	
307010039	
307010040	I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.
307010041	
307010042	
307010043	
307010044	
307010045	
307010046	
307010047	
307010048	
307010049	
307010050	Even you can do that much, can't you?
307011000	Good, good.
307011001	
307011002	
307011003	
307011004	
307011005	
307011006	
307011007	
307011008	
307011009	
307011010	Now I shall hand over the potion in question.
307011011	
307011012	
307011013	
307011014	
307011015	
307011016	
307011017	
307011018	
307011019	
307011020	Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.
307011021	
307011022	
307011023	
307011024	
307011025	
307011026	
307011027	
307011028	
307011029	
307011030	I expect glad tidings. And soon.
307012000	I see...
307012001	
307012002	
307012003	
307012004	
307012005	
307012006	
307012007	
307012008	
307012009	
307012010	What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are.
307012011	
307012012	
307012013	
307012014	
307012015	
307012016	
307012017	
307012018	
307012019	
307012020	Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance.
307012021	
307012022	
307012023	
307012024	
307012025	
307012026	
307012027	
307012028	
307012029	
307012030	If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me.
307012031	
307012032	
307012033	
307012034	
307012035	
307012036	
307012037	
307012038	
307012039	
307012040	Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not?
307012041	
307012042	
307012043	
307012044	
307012045	
307012046	
307012047	
307012048	
307012049	
307012050	Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer.
307013000	Have you fumbled out the correct answer now?
307013001	
307013002	
307013003	
307013004	
307013005	
307013006	
307013007	
307013008	
307013009	
307013010	Then you will undertake my task?
307014000	...
307014001	
307014002	
307014003	
307014004	
307014005	
307014006	
307014007	
307014008	
307014009	
307014010	You are peerless in your dullardry.
307014011	
307014012	
307014013	
307014014	
307014015	
307014016	
307014017	
307014018	
307014019	
307014020	Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence.
307014021	
307014022	
307014023	
307014024	
307014025	
307014026	
307014027	
307014028	
307014029	
307014030	Don't bother wasting your breath on me again.
307015000	I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more...
307015001	
307015002	
307015003	
307015004	
307015005	
307015006	
307015007	
307015008	
307015009	
307015010	Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task?
307016000	Good, good.
307016001	
307016002	
307016003	
307016004	
307016005	
307016006	
307016007	
307016008	
307016009	
307016010	As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.
307016011	
307016012	
307016013	
307016014	
307016015	
307016016	
307016017	
307016018	
307016019	
307016020	Now I shall hand over the potion in question.
307016021	
307016022	
307016023	
307016024	
307016025	
307016026	
307016027	
307016028	
307016029	
307016030	Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.
307016031	
307016032	
307016033	
307016034	
307016035	
307016036	
307016037	
307016038	
307016039	
307016040	I expect glad tidings. And soon.
307017000	I've no time for idle chit chat.
307017001	
307017002	
307017003	
307017004	
307017005	
307017006	
307017007	
307017008	
307017009	
307017010	The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion.
307017011	
307017012	
307017013	
307017014	
307017015	
307017016	
307017017	
307017018	
307017019	
307017020	Are we understood? Then off you trot.
307017021	
307017022	
307017023	
307017024	
307017025	
307017026	
307017027	
307017028	
307017029	
307017030	I have enough on my plate.
307030000	Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?
307030001	
307030002	
307030003	
307030004	
307030005	
307030006	
307030007	
307030008	
307030009	
307030010	Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.
307030011	Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought.
307030012	
307030013	
307030014	
307030015	
307030016	
307030017	
307030018	
307030019	
307030020	Very well. Then you shall have your gift.
307030021	
307030022	
307030023	
307030024	
307030025	
307030026	
307030027	
307030028	
307030029	
307030030	Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.
307030031	
307030032	
307030033	
307030034	
307030035	
307030036	
307030037	
307030038	
307030039	
307030040	I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...
307030041	
307030042	
307030043	
307030044	
307030045	
307030046	
307030047	
307030048	
307030049	
307030050	If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.
307031000	You wish to begin right this moment?
307031001	
307031002	
307031003	
307031004	
307031005	
307031006	
307031007	
307031008	
307031009	
307031010	Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.
307032000	Begging for another lesson so soon?
307032001	
307032002	
307032003	
307032004	
307032005	
307032006	
307032007	
307032008	
307032009	
307032010	There remains much to be done. Make it quick.
307033000	Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not.
307033001	
307033002	
307033003	
307033004	
307033005	
307033006	
307033007	
307033008	
307033009	
307033010	Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.
307040000	Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?
307040001	
307040002	
307040003	
307040004	
307040005	
307040006	
307040007	
307040008	
307040009	
307040010	The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?
307040011	
307040012	
307040013	
307040014	
307040015	
307040016	
307040017	
307040018	
307040019	
307040020	Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.
307040021	
307040022	
307040023	
307040024	
307040025	
307040026	
307040027	
307040028	
307040029	
307040030	Well...there's no helping it.
307040031	
307040032	
307040033	
307040034	
307040035	
307040036	
307040037	
307040038	
307040039	
307040040	Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.
307040041	
307040042	
307040043	
307040044	
307040045	
307040046	
307040047	
307040048	
307040049	
307040050	There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.
307040051	
307040052	
307040053	
307040054	
307040055	
307040056	
307040057	
307040058	
307040059	
307040060	She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.
307040061	
307040062	
307040063	
307040064	
307040065	
307040066	
307040067	
307040068	
307040069	
307040070	I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.
307040071	
307040072	
307040073	
307040074	
307040075	
307040076	
307040077	
307040078	
307040079	
307040080	I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.
307041000	So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?
307041001	
307041002	
307041003	
307041004	
307041005	
307041006	
307041007	
307041008	
307041009	
307041010	Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.
307041011	
307041012	
307041013	
307041014	
307041015	
307041016	
307041017	
307041018	
307041019	
307041020	It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.
307041021	
307041022	
307041023	
307041024	
307041025	
307041026	
307041027	
307041028	
307041029	
307041030	I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.
307050000	You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?
307050001	
307050002	
307050003	
307050004	
307050005	
307050006	
307050007	
307050008	
307050009	
307050010	Your oafishness knows no bounds.
307050011	
307050012	
307050013	
307050014	
307050015	
307050016	
307050017	
307050018	
307050019	
307050020	Fine and well.
307050021	
307050022	
307050023	
307050024	
307050025	
307050026	
307050027	
307050028	
307050029	
307050030	You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.
307050031	
307050032	
307050033	
307050034	
307050035	
307050036	
307050037	
307050038	
307050039	
307050040	I believe that makes you my accomplice.
307050041	
307050042	
307050043	
307050044	
307050045	
307050046	
307050047	
307050048	
307050049	
307050050	You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?
307050051	
307050052	
307050053	
307050054	
307050055	
307050056	
307050057	
307050058	
307050059	
307050060	Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.
307050061	
307050062	
307050063	
307050064	
307050065	
307050066	
307050067	
307050068	
307050069	
307050070	But perhaps I can make a very special exception.
307050071	
307050072	
307050073	
307050074	
307050075	
307050076	
307050077	
307050078	
307050079	
307050080	Now, choose.
307051000	Ah, I knew you'd see things my way.
307051001	
307051002	
307051003	
307051004	
307051005	
307051006	
307051007	
307051008	
307051009	
307051010	You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such...
307051011	
307051012	
307051013	
307051014	
307051015	
307051016	
307051017	
307051018	
307051019	
307051020	You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish.
307051021	
307051022	
307051023	
307051024	
307051025	
307051026	
307051027	
307051028	
307051029	
307051030	Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.
307051031	Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.
307051032	
307051033	
307051034	
307051035	
307051036	
307051037	
307051038	
307051039	
307051040	Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.
307051041	
307051042	
307051043	
307051044	
307051045	
307051046	
307051047	
307051048	
307051049	
307051050	To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.
307051051	
307051052	
307051053	
307051054	
307051055	
307051056	
307051057	
307051058	
307051059	
307051060	Now, choose.
307052000	Well, this is a surprise.
307052001	
307052002	
307052003	
307052004	
307052005	
307052006	
307052007	
307052008	
307052009	
307052010	But aren't we forgetting something?
307052011	
307052012	
307052013	
307052014	
307052015	
307052016	
307052017	
307052018	
307052019	
307052020	The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught.
307052021	
307052022	
307052023	
307052024	
307052025	
307052026	
307052027	
307052028	
307052029	
307052030	You are already my accomplice.
307052031	
307052032	
307052033	
307052034	
307052035	
307052036	
307052037	
307052038	
307052039	
307052040	Are you ready to change your mind, now?
307052041	
307052042	
307052043	
307052044	
307052045	
307052046	
307052047	
307052048	
307052049	
307052050	It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish.
307053000	Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss.
307053001	
307053002	
307053003	
307053004	
307053005	
307053006	
307053007	
307053008	
307053009	
307053010	Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own.
307054000	(huge sigh)
307054001	
307054002	
307054003	
307054004	
307054005	
307054006	
307054007	
307054008	
307054009	
307054010	You truly are beyond salvation.
307054011	
307054012	
307054013	
307054014	
307054015	
307054016	
307054017	
307054018	
307054019	
307054020	Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again.
307054021	
307054022	
307054023	
307054024	
307054025	
307054026	
307054027	
307054028	
307054029	
307054030	Ah, what a terrible pity.
307054031	
307054032	
307054033	
307054034	
307054035	
307054036	
307054037	
307054038	
307054039	
307054040	This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state.
307055000	I thought I told you never to show your face again.
307055001	
307055002	
307055003	
307055004	
307055005	
307055006	
307055007	
307055008	
307055009	
307055010	Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology?
307056000	Good, good.
307056001	
307056002	
307056003	
307056004	
307056005	
307056006	
307056007	
307056008	
307056009	
307056010	As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.
307056011	
307056012	
307056013	
307056014	
307056015	
307056016	
307056017	
307056018	
307056019	
307056020	And well, you finally realised, did you?
307056021	
307056022	
307056023	
307056024	
307056025	
307056026	
307056027	
307056028	
307056029	
307056030	All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart.
307056031	
307056032	
307056033	
307056034	
307056035	
307056036	
307056037	
307056038	
307056039	
307056040	Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.
307056041	Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.
307056042	
307056043	
307056044	
307056045	
307056046	
307056047	
307056048	
307056049	
307056050	Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.
307056051	
307056052	
307056053	
307056054	
307056055	
307056056	
307056057	
307056058	
307056059	
307056060	To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.
307056061	
307056062	
307056063	
307056064	
307056065	
307056066	
307056067	
307056068	
307056069	
307056070	Now, choose.
307060000	How's the puppet I gave you?
307060001	
307060002	
307060003	
307060004	
307060005	
307060006	
307060007	
307060008	
307060009	
307060010	A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?
307070000	What's that? You want another puppet?
307070001	
307070002	
307070003	
307070004	
307070005	
307070006	
307070007	
307070008	
307070009	
307070010	Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.
307070011	Well, aren't you a woman of many passions.
307070012	
307070013	
307070014	
307070015	
307070016	
307070017	
307070018	
307070019	
307070020	But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.
307070021	
307070022	
307070023	
307070024	
307070025	
307070026	
307070027	
307070028	
307070029	
307070030	I can hardly just give them away.
307070031	
307070032	
307070033	
307070034	
307070035	
307070036	
307070037	
307070038	
307070039	
307070040	Oh dear, what's to be done?
307070041	
307070042	
307070043	
307070044	
307070045	
307070046	
307070047	
307070048	
307070049	
307070050	Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?
307070051	
307070052	
307070053	
307070054	
307070055	
307070056	
307070057	
307070058	
307070059	
307070060	It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue.
307070061	
307070062	
307070063	
307070064	
307070065	
307070066	
307070067	
307070068	
307070069	
307070070	If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.
307070071	
307070072	
307070073	
307070074	
307070075	
307070076	
307070077	
307070078	
307070079	
307070080	The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.
307070081	
307070082	
307070083	
307070084	
307070085	
307070086	
307070087	
307070088	
307070089	
307070090	And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.
307070091	
307070092	
307070093	
307070094	
307070095	
307070096	
307070097	
307070098	
307070099	
307070100	Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.
307080000	You're proving to be quite the puppeteer.
307080001	
307080002	
307080003	
307080004	
307080005	
307080006	
307080007	
307080008	
307080009	
307080010	I've not had an apprentice for…a very long time indeed.
307081000	Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?
307081001	
307081002	
307081003	
307081004	
307081005	
307081006	
307081007	
307081008	
307081009	
307081010	It will produce the finest of puppets.
307081011	
307081012	
307081013	
307081014	
307081015	
307081016	
307081017	
307081018	
307081019	
307081020	Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.
307081021	
307081022	
307081023	
307081024	
307081025	
307081026	
307081027	
307081028	
307081029	
307081030	A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?
307082000	Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.
307082001	Heh. I knew I had you pegged.
307082002	
307082003	
307082004	
307082005	
307082006	
307082007	
307082008	
307082009	
307082010	You're just like me.
307082011	
307082012	
307082013	
307082014	
307082015	
307082016	
307082017	
307082018	
307082019	
307082020	Then I'd like you to procure something.
307082021	
307082022	
307082023	
307082024	
307082025	
307082026	
307082027	
307082028	
307082029	
307082030	A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.
307082031	
307082032	
307082033	
307082034	
307082035	
307082036	
307082037	
307082038	
307082039	
307082040	With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.
307082041	
307082042	
307082043	
307082044	
307082045	
307082046	
307082047	
307082048	
307082049	
307082050	And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...
307082051	
307082052	
307082053	
307082054	
307082055	
307082056	
307082057	
307082058	
307082059	
307082060	Procure it for me.
307082061	
307082062	
307082063	
307082064	
307082065	
307082066	
307082067	
307082068	
307082069	
307082070	The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.
307082071	
307082072	
307082073	
307082074	
307082075	
307082076	
307082077	
307082078	
307082079	
307082080	With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.
307082081	
307082082	
307082083	
307082084	
307082085	
307082086	
307082087	
307082088	
307082089	
307082090	And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...
307083000	Very good.
307083001	
307083002	
307083003	
307083004	
307083005	
307083006	
307083007	
307083008	
307083009	
307083010	A wise choice, indeed.
307083011	
307083012	
307083013	
307083014	
307083015	
307083016	
307083017	
307083018	
307083019	
307083020	You passed my little test with flying colours.
307083021	
307083022	
307083023	
307083024	
307083025	
307083026	
307083027	
307083028	
307083029	
307083030	I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni.
307083031	
307083032	
307083033	
307083034	
307083035	
307083036	
307083037	
307083038	
307083039	
307083040	Well done, I'm very proud of you.
307083041	
307083042	
307083043	
307083044	
307083045	
307083046	
307083047	
307083048	
307083049	
307083050	Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.
307084000	Ah ha. Might you be interested after all?
307084001	
307084002	
307084003	
307084004	
307084005	
307084006	
307084007	
307084008	
307084009	
307084010	In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni?
307085000	Alright, enough of these games.
307085001	
307085002	
307085003	
307085004	
307085005	
307085006	
307085007	
307085008	
307085009	
307085010	Your test is well and truly over.
307085011	
307085012	
307085013	
307085014	
307085015	
307085016	
307085017	
307085018	
307085019	
307085020	Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind.
307085021	
307085022	
307085023	
307085024	
307085025	
307085026	
307085027	
307085028	
307085029	
307085030	I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams.
307090000	Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!
307090001	
307090002	
307090003	
307090004	
307090005	
307090006	
307090007	
307090008	
307090009	
307090010	The blessed day is finally upon us...
307090011	
307090012	
307090013	
307090014	
307090015	
307090016	
307090017	
307090018	
307090019	
307090020	Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.
307090021	
307090022	
307090023	
307090024	
307090025	
307090026	
307090027	
307090028	
307090029	
307090030	To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...
307090031	
307090032	
307090033	
307090034	
307090035	
307090036	
307090037	
307090038	
307090039	
307090040	My oh my oh my...
307091000	Ah, are you still here?
307091001	
307091002	
307091003	
307091004	
307091005	
307091006	
307091007	
307091008	
307091009	
307091010	Oh yes, I should give you your reward.
307091011	
307091012	
307091013	
307091014	
307091015	
307091016	
307091017	
307091018	
307091019	
307091020	Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous.
307091021	
307091022	
307091023	
307091024	
307091025	
307091026	
307091027	
307091028	
307091029	
307091030	Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.
307091031	
307091032	
307091033	
307091034	
307091035	
307091036	
307091037	
307091038	
307091039	
307091040	The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...
307092000	Good, I've been waiting for you.
307092001	
307092002	
307092003	
307092004	
307092005	
307092006	
307092007	
307092008	
307092009	
307092010	It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.
307092011	
307092012	
307092013	
307092014	
307092015	
307092016	
307092017	
307092018	
307092019	
307092020	Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.
307092021	
307092022	
307092023	
307092024	
307092025	
307092026	
307092027	
307092028	
307092029	
307092030	The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.
307092031	
307092032	
307092033	
307092034	
307092035	
307092036	
307092037	
307092038	
307092039	
307092040	Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.
307092041	
307092042	
307092043	
307092044	
307092045	
307092046	
307092047	
307092048	
307092049	
307092050	Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it.
307092051	
307092052	
307092053	
307092054	
307092055	
307092056	
307092057	
307092058	
307092059	
307092060	Which is why you're the only one for the job.
307092061	
307092062	
307092063	
307092064	
307092065	
307092066	
307092067	
307092068	
307092069	
307092070	Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught.
307093000	You...understand, don't you?
307093001	
307093002	
307093003	
307093004	
307093005	
307093006	
307093007	
307093008	
307093009	
307093010	That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.
307093011	
307093012	
307093013	
307093014	
307093015	
307093016	
307093017	
307093018	
307093019	
307093020	And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.
307093021	
307093022	
307093023	
307093024	
307093025	
307093026	
307093027	
307093028	
307093029	
307093030	Just imagine...the pure elation...
307094000	Come now, don't make me wait.
307094001	
307094002	
307094003	
307094004	
307094005	
307094006	
307094007	
307094008	
307094009	
307094010	I can barely contain myself as it is...
307095000	You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.
307095001	
307095002	
307095003	
307095004	
307095005	
307095006	
307095007	
307095008	
307095009	
307095010	The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...
307100000	Hmm. Is that a scroll?
307100001	
307100002	
307100003	
307100004	
307100005	
307100006	
307100007	
307100008	
307100009	
307100010	I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...
307100011	
307100012	
307100013	
307100014	
307100015	
307100016	
307100017	
307100018	
307100019	
307100020	You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.
307100021	
307100022	
307100023	
307100024	
307100025	
307100026	
307100027	
307100028	
307100029	
307100030	So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.
307100031	
307100032	
307100033	
307100034	
307100035	
307100036	
307100037	
307100038	
307100039	
307100040	That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.
307100041	
307100042	
307100043	
307100044	
307100045	
307100046	
307100047	
307100048	
307100049	
307100050	More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect…
307100051	
307100052	
307100053	
307100054	
307100055	
307100056	
307100057	
307100058	
307100059	
307100060	…upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.
307110000	Oh, perhaps you've already noticed.
307110001	
307110002	
307110003	
307110004	
307110005	
307110006	
307110007	
307110008	
307110009	
307110010	The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here.
307110011	
307110012	
307110013	
307110014	
307110015	
307110016	
307110017	
307110018	
307110019	
307110020	If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town,
307110021	
307110022	
307110023	
307110024	
307110025	
307110026	
307110027	
307110028	
307110029	
307110030	then tell him to pack up and ship out.
307110031	
307110032	
307110033	
307110034	
307110035	
307110036	
307110037	
307110038	
307110039	
307110040	I never liked the din of a dog's howl.
307110041	
307110042	
307110043	
307110044	
307110045	
307110046	
307110047	
307110048	
307110049	
307110050	From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony.
307120000	Well, what have we here?
307120001	
307120002	
307120003	
307120004	
307120005	
307120006	
307120007	
307120008	
307120009	
307120010	Are you proposing that I partake?
307120011	
307120012	
307120013	
307120014	
307120015	
307120016	
307120017	
307120018	
307120019	
307120020	Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you?
307120021	
307120022	
307120023	
307120024	
307120025	
307120026	
307120027	
307120028	
307120029	
307120030	A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss?
307120031	
307120032	
307120033	
307120034	
307120035	
307120036	
307120037	
307120038	
307120039	
307120040	Well, let me give you some advice.
307120041	
307120042	
307120043	
307120044	
307120045	
307120046	
307120047	
307120048	
307120049	
307120050	Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against.
307120051	
307120052	
307120053	
307120054	
307120055	
307120056	
307120057	
307120058	
307120059	
307120060	You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day.
307200000	O-oh!
307200001	
307200002	
307200003	
307200004	
307200005	
307200006	
307200007	
307200008	
307200009	
307200010	Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship...
307200011	Y-you! I, er, sorry, madam...
307200012	
307200013	
307200014	
307200015	
307200016	
307200017	
307200018	
307200019	
307200020	I-I apologise for any offence given.
307200021	
307200022	
307200023	
307200024	
307200025	
307200026	
307200027	
307200028	
307200029	
307200030	I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family.
307200031	
307200032	
307200033	
307200034	
307200035	
307200036	
307200037	
307200038	
307200039	
307200040	I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.
307201000	Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use.
307201001	Ahh, kind madam, allow me to be of use.
307201002	
307201003	
307201004	
307201005	
307201006	
307201007	
307201008	
307201009	
307201010	Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom.
307201011	
307201012	
307201013	
307201014	
307201015	
307201016	
307201017	
307201018	
307201019	
307201020	Why not pick something out, before you go?
307201021	
307201022	
307201023	
307201024	
307201025	
307201026	
307201027	
307201028	
307201029	
307201030	But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia...
307201031	
307201032	
307201033	
307201034	
307201035	
307201036	
307201037	
307201038	
307201039	
307201040	A little something by way of compensation?
307202000	Ah, a fine day to your worship.
307202001	Ah, kind madam, a fine day to y-you.
307202002	
307202003	
307202004	
307202005	
307202006	
307202007	
307202008	
307202009	
307202010	Please, choose whatever you like.
307203000	Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has.
307203001	Ah, I'm sorry kind madam, but poor Pidia has given all he has.
307203002	
307203003	
307203004	
307203005	
307203006	
307203007	
307203008	
307203009	
307203010	I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me.
307204000	Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me...
307205000	Argh!
307205001	
307205002	
307205003	
307205004	
307205005	
307205006	
307205007	
307205008	
307205009	
307205010	Arrgh!
307205011	
307205012	
307205013	
307205014	
307205015	
307205016	
307205017	
307205018	
307205019	
307205020	S-stop, please, stop!
307205021	
307205022	
307205023	
307205024	
307205025	
307205026	
307205027	
307205028	
307205029	
307205030	Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have!
307205031	
307205032	
307205033	
307205034

307210030	If you will, please forget this matter entirely.
307800000	Agh!
307801000	Enough of that, now.

309003020	I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man!
309004000	Cripes, are you dense, boy?
309004001	Cripes, are you dense, sweetheart?
309004002

309004010	Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.

309004020	We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!
309005000	Well, finally come around, have you?

309006027	
309006028	
309006029	
309006030	I took you for a demi-human, or some such.

309006036	
309006037	
309006038	
309006039	
309006040	An innocent mistake, I assure you.
309006041

309006043	
309006044	
309006045

309006047	
309006048	
309006049	
309006050	Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?
309007000	A true man of reason. Just what I like about you.
309007001	A true lady of reason. Just what I like about you.

309007026	
309007027	
309007028	
309007029	
309007030	Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.

309007047	
309007048	
309007049	
309007050	But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.

309024013	
309024014	
309024015	
309024016	
309024017	
309024018	
309024019	
309024020	I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying,
309024021	
309024022	
309024023	
309024024	
309024025	
309024026	
309024027	
309024028	
309024029	
309024030	but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection.
309024031	
309024032	
309024033	
309024034	
309024035	
309024036	
309024037	
309024038	
309024039	
309024040	They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.
309024041	
309024042	
309024043	
309024044	
309024045	
309024046	
309024047	
309024048	
309024049	
309024050	Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish.
309024051	
309024052	
309024053	
309024054	
309024055	
309024056	
309024057	
309024058	
309024059	
309024060	...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.
309025000	Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest?
309025001	
309025002	
309025003	
309025004	
309025005	
309025006	
309025007	
309025008	
309025009	
309025010	Well, it's uh, nothing too special.
309025011	
309025012	
309025013	
309025014	
309025015	
309025016	
309025017	
309025018	
309025019	
309025020	Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...
309025021	
309025022	
309025023	
309025024	
309025025	
309025026	
309025027	
309025028	
309025029	
309025030	But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...
309025031	
309025032	
309025033	
309025034	
309025035	
309025036	
309025037	
309025038	
309025039	
309025040	And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...
309025041	
309025042	
309025043	
309025044	
309025045	
309025046	
309025047	
309025048	
309025049	
309025050	Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.
309026000	Forgot something on your shopping list?
309026001	
309026002	
309026003	
309026004	
309026005	
309026006	
309026007	
309026008	
309026009	
309026010	No, no trouble to me.
309041000	By the way, friend...
309041001	
309041002	
309041003	
309041004	
309041005	
309041006	
309041007	
309041008	
309041009	
309041010	You've really been there for me, through thick and thin.
309041011	
309041012	
309041013	
309041014	
309041015	
309041016	
309041017	
309041018	
309041019	
309041020	And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.
309041021	
309041022	
309041023	
309041024	
309041025	
309041026	
309041027	
309041028	
309041029	
309041030	An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer.
309042000	What's wrong? I've made up my mind.
309042001	
309042002	
309042003	
309042004	
309042005	
309042006	
309042007	
309042008	
309042009	
309042010	The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed.
309042011	
309042012	
309042013	
309042014	
309042015	
309042016	
309042017	
309042018	
309042019	
309042020	Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold.
309042021	
309042022	
309042023	
309042024	
309042025	
309042026	
309042027	
309042028	
309042029	
309042030	But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless!
309050000	Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.
309050001	
309050002	
309050003	
309050004	
309050005	
309050006	
309050007	
309050008	
309050009	
309050010	You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.
309050011	
309050012	
309050013	
309050014	
309050015	
309050016	
309050017	
309050018	
309050019	
309050020	Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm?
309050021	
309050022	
309050023	
309050024	
309050025	
309050026	
309050027	
309050028	
309050029	
309050030	But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience.
309050031	
309050032	
309050033	
309050034	
309050035	
309050036	
309050037	
309050038	
309050039	
309050040	At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.
309050041	
309050042	
309050043	
309050044	
309050045	
309050046	
309050047	
309050048	
309050049	
309050050	And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!
309051000	Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.
309051001	
309051002	
309051003	
309051004	
309051005	
309051006	
309051007	
309051008	
309051009	
309051010	You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.
309051011	
309051012	
309051013	
309051014	
309051015	
309051016	
309051017	
309051018	
309051019	
309051020	Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests?
309051021	
309051022	
309051023	
309051024	
309051025	
309051026	
309051027	
309051028	
309051029	
309051030	No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate.
309051031	
309051032	
309051033	
309051034	
309051035	
309051036	
309051037	
309051038	
309051039	
309051040	At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.
309051041	
309051042	
309051043	
309051044	
309051045	
309051046	
309051047	
309051048	
309051049	
309051050	And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!
309060000	Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave.
309060001	
309060002	
309060003	
309060004	
309060005	
309060006	
309060007	
309060008	
309060009	
309060010	I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on.
309060011	
309060012	
309060013	
309060014	
309060015	
309060016	
309060017	
309060018	
309060019	
309060020	No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop.
309060021	
309060022	
309060023	
309060024	
309060025	
309060026	
309060027	
309060028	
309060029	
309060030	They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face.
309060031	
309060032	
309060033	
309060034	
309060035	
309060036	
309060037	
309060038	
309060039	
309060040	Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?
309070000	Oh, well! It's been a long while.
309070001	
309070002	
309070003	
309070004	
309070005	
309070006	
309070007	
309070008	
309070009	
309070010	It's me. Patches the Untethered.
309070011	
309070012	
309070013	
309070014	
309070015	
309070016	
309070017	
309070018	
309070019	
309070020	I'm still in business, if you can believe it.
309070021	
309070022	
309070023	
309070024	
309070025	
309070026	
309070027	
309070028	
309070029	
309070030	Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch.
309070031	
309070032	
309070033	
309070034	
309070035	
309070036	
309070037	
309070038	
309070039	
309070040	Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.
309071000	You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell.
309071001	
309071002	
309071003	
309071004	
309071005	
309071006	
309071007	
309071008	
309071009	
309071010	That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt.
309071011	
309071012	
309071013	
309071014	
309071015	
309071016	
309071017	
309071018	
309071019	
309071020	In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it...
309071021	
309071022	
309071023	
309071024	
309071025	
309071026	
309071027	
309071028	
309071029	
309071030	(laughs)
309072000	Oh, really? No interest in the statuette?
309072001	
309072002	
309072003	
309072004	
309072005	
309072006	
309072007	
309072008	
309072009	
309072010	I was sure it would catch your eye.
309072011	
309072012	
309072013	
309072014	
309072015	
309072016	
309072017	
309072018	
309072019	
309072020	Well, I can't force it on you, but...
309072021	
309072022	
309072023	
309072024	
309072025	
309072026	
309072027	
309072028	
309072029	
309072030	Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else...
309073000	By the way, have you met that girl Rya?
309073001	
309073002	
309073003	
309073004	
309073005	
309073006	
309073007	
309073008	
309073009	
309073010	I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago.
309073011	
309073012	
309073013	
309073014	
309073015	
309073016	
309073017	
309073018	
309073019	
309073020	She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help.
309073021	
309073022	
309073023	
309073024	
309073025	
309073026	
309073027	
309073028	
309073029	
309073030	Not that it's any of my business, but...
309073031	
309073032	
309073033	
309073034	
309073035	
309073036	
309073037	
309073038	
309073039	
309073040	If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?
309074000	Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose.
309080000	Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine...
309080001	
309080002	
309080003	
309080004	
309080005	
309080006	
309080007	
309080008	
309080009	
309080010	Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!
309081000	You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no?
309081001	
309081002	
309081003	
309081004	
309081005	
309081006	
309081007	
309081008	
309081009	
309081010	Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.
309081011	
309081012	
309081013	
309081014	
309081015	
309081016	
309081017	
309081018	
309081019	
309081020	Have you ever seen an iron virgin?
309081021	
309081022	
309081023	
309081024	
309081025	
309081026	
309081027	
309081028	
309081029	
309081030	The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels.
309081031	
309081032	
309081033	
309081034	
309081035	
309081036	
309081037	
309081038	
309081039	
309081040	...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.
309081041	
309081042	
309081043	
309081044	
309081045	
309081046	
309081047	
309081048	
309081049	
309081050	And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
309081051	
309081052	
309081053	
309081054	
309081055	
309081056	
309081057	
309081058	
309081059	
309081060	Its transpositional powers fully intact.
309081061	
309081062	
309081063	
309081064	
309081065	
309081066	
309081067	
309081068	
309081069	
309081070	So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...
309081071	
309081072	
309081073	
309081074	
309081075	
309081076	
309081077	
309081078	
309081079	
309081080	It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...

309081084	
309081085	
309081086	
309081087	
309081088	
309081089	
309081090	Ha ha...ha ha...
309082000	Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.
309082001	
309082002	
309082003	
309082004	
309082005	
309082006	
309082007	
309082008	
309082009	
309082010	There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
309082011	
309082012	
309082013	
309082014	
309082015	
309082016	
309082017	
309082018	
309082019	
309082020	And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.
309082021	
309082022	
309082023	
309082024	
309082025	
309082026	
309082027	
309082028	
309082029	
309082030	Heh heh...ha ha...
309090000	Well, fancy meeting you here.
309090001	
309090002	
309090003	
309090004	
309090005	
309090006	
309090007	
309090008	
309090009	
309090010	Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend.
309090011	
309090012	
309090013	
309090014	
309090015	
309090016	
309090017	
309090018	
309090019	
309090020	I spoke no lie, not a one.
309090021	
309090022	
309090023	
309090024	
309090025	
309090026	
309090027	
309090028	
309090029	
309090030	You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,
309090031	
309090032	
309090033	
309090034	
309090035	
309090036	
309090037	
309090038	
309090039	
309090040	but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.
309090041	
309090042	
309090043	
309090044	
309090045	
309090046	
309090047	
309090048	
309090049	
309090050	I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.
309090051	
309090052	
309090053	
309090054	
309090055	
309090056	
309090057	
309090058	
309090059	
309090060	But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?
309101000	Oh, erm, hello, yes.
309101001	
309101002	
309101003	
309101004	
309101005	
309101006	
309101007	
309101008	
309101009	
309101010	Strange place for a chance encounter, eh?
309101011	
309101012	
309101013	
309101014	
309101015	
309101016	
309101017	
309101018	
309101019	
309101020	Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business.
309101021	
309101022	
309101023	
309101024	
309101025	
309101026	
309101027	
309101028	
309101029	
309101030	Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.
309101031	
309101032	
309101033	
309101034	
309101035	
309101036	
309101037	
309101038	
309101039	
309101040	Heh heh heh...
309102000	What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot.
309102001	
309102002	
309102003	
309102004	
309102005	
309102006	
309102007	
309102008	
309102009	
309102010	Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.
309102011	
309102012	
309102013	
309102014	
309102015	
309102016	
309102017	
309102018	
309102019	
309102020	Heh heh heh...
309110000	Oh, my, well, here you are again.
309110001	
309110002	
309110003	
309110004	
309110005	
309110006	
309110007	
309110008	
309110009	
309110010	So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went.
309110011	
309110012	
309110013	
309110014	
309110015	
309110016	
309110017	
309110018	
309110019	
309110020	Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have.
309110021	
309110022	
309110023	
309110024	
309110025	
309110026	
309110027	
309110028	
309110029	
309110030	But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh.
309110031	
309110032	
309110033	
309110034	
309110035	
309110036	
309110037	
309110038	
309110039	
309110040	And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!
309110041	
309110042	
309110043	
309110044	
309110045	
309110046	
309110047	
309110048	
309110049	
309110050	Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.
309110051	
309110052	
309110053	
309110054	
309110055	
309110056	
309110057	
309110058	
309110059	
309110060	I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.
309110061	
309110062	
309110063	
309110064	
309110065	
309110066	
309110067	
309110068	
309110069	
309110070	Mm...heh heh...
309111000	You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again.
309111001	
309111002	
309111003	
309111004	
309111005	
309111006	
309111007	
309111008	
309111009	
309111010	Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.
309111011	
309111012	
309111013	
309111014	
309111015	
309111016	
309111017	
309111018	
309111019	
309111020	I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.
309111021	
309111022	
309111023	
309111024	
309111025	
309111026	
309111027	
309111028	
309111029	
309111030	Heh heh...heh heh...
309120000	Well, you've joined the Manor, eh?
309120001	
309120002	
309120003	
309120004	
309120005	
309120006	
309120007	
309120008	
309120009	
309120010	I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.
309120011	
309120012	
309120013	
309120014	
309120015	
309120016	
309120017	
309120018	
309120019	
309120020	And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree...
309120021	
309120022	
309120023	
309120024	
309120025	
309120026	
309120027	
309120028	
309120029	
309120030	All good, though. We're on the same side, now.
309120031	
309120032	
309120033	
309120034	
309120035	
309120036	
309120037	
309120038	
309120039	
309120040	We'll do good work together.
309121000	Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like.
309121001	
309121002	
309121003	
309121004	
309121005	
309121006	
309121007	
309121008	
309121009	
309121010	Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.
309130000	Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing.
309130001	
309130002	
309130003	
309130004	
309130005	
309130006	
309130007	
309130008	
309130009	
309130010	This is for you.
309131000	You're new here at the Manor.
309131001	
309131002	
309131003	
309131004	
309131005	
309131006	
309131007	
309131008	
309131009	
309131010	But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.
309131011	
309131012	
309131013	
309131014	
309131015	
309131016	
309131017	
309131018	
309131019	
309131020	Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right?
309131021	
309131022	
309131023	
309131024	
309131025	
309131026	
309131027	
309131028	
309131029	
309131030	Go on, break a leg, then.
309131031	
309131032	
309131033	
309131034	
309131035	
309131036	
309131037	
309131038	
309131039	
309131040	Heh heh...
309132000	What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?
309132001	
309132002	
309132003	
309132004	
309132005	
309132006	
309132007	
309132008	
309132009	
309132010	Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.
309132011	
309132012	
309132013	
309132014	
309132015	
309132016	
309132017	
309132018	
309132019	
309132020	We're not here to make your life easier.
309132021	
309132022	
309132023	
309132024	
309132025	
309132026	
309132027	
309132028	
309132029	
309132030	Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.
309132031	
309132032	
309132033	
309132034	
309132035	
309132036	
309132037	
309132038	
309132039	
309132040	Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?
309133040	You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?
309134000	You hunted down Tragoth?
309134001	
309134002	
309134003	
309134004	
309134005	
309134006	
309134007	
309134008	
309134009	
309134010	Are you certain?
309134011	
309134012	
309134013	
309134014	
309134015	
309134016	
309134017	
309134018	
309134019	
309134020	No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.
309134021	
309134022	
309134023	
309134024	
309134025	
309134026	
309134027	
309134028	
309134029	
309134030	I'll give Tanith the news.
309134031	
309134032	
309134033	
309134034	
309134035	
309134036	
309134037	
309134038	
309134039	
309134040	Have some rest, by all means.
309135000	Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.
309135001	
309135002	
309135003	
309135004	
309135005	
309135006	
309135007	
309135008	
309135009	
309135010	I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers.
309135011	
309135012	
309135013	
309135014	
309135015	
309135016	
309135017	
309135018	
309135019	
309135020	I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.
309135021	
309135022	
309135023	
309135024	
309135025	
309135026	
309135027	
309135028	
309135029	
309135030	Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.
309135031	
309135032	
309135033	
309135034	
309135035	
309135036	
309135037	
309135038	
309135039	
309135040	I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.
309135041	
309135042	
309135043	
309135044	
309135045	
309135046	
309135047	
309135048	
309135049	
309135050	Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.
309135051	
309135052	
309135053	
309135054	
309135055	
309135056	
309135057	
309135058	
309135059	
309135060	I've never seen a woman quite like her...
309136000	Hmph.
309136001	
309136002	
309136003	
309136004	
309136005	
309136006	
309136007	
309136008	
309136009	
309136010	Sharper than you seem, aren't you...
309136011	
309136012	
309136013	
309136014	
309136015	
309136016	
309136017	
309136018	
309136019	
309136020	I was just holding onto it for you, you know.
309136021	
309136022	
309136023	
309136024	
309136025	
309136026	
309136027	
309136028	
309136029	
309136030	Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.
309150000	Now you've gone and killed Rykard?
309150001	
309150002	
309150003	
309150004	
309150005	
309150006	
309150007	
309150008	
309150009	
309150010	You scheming little bastard.
309150011	You scheming little doxie.
309150012	
309150013	
309150014	
309150015	
309150016	
309150017	
309150018	
309150019	
309150020	Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...
309150021	
309150022	
309150023	
309150024	
309150025	
309150026	
309150027	
309150028	
309150029	
309150030	Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...
309150031	
309150032	
309150033	
309150034	
309150035	
309150036	
309150037	
309150038	
309150039	
309150040	But for now, this Manor is finished.
309150041	
309150042	
309150043	
309150044	
309150045	
309150046	
309150047	
309150048	
309150049	
309150050	The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.
309150051	
309150052	
309150053	
309150054	
309150055	
309150056	
309150057	
309150058	
309150059	
309150060	A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.
309150061	
309150062	
309150063	
309150064	
309150065	
309150066	
309150067	
309150068	
309150069	
309150070	Heh heh...ha ha...
309150071	
309150072	
309150073	
309150074	
309150075	
309150076	
309150077	
309150078	
309150079	
309150080	Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.
309150081	
309150082	
309150083	
309150084	
309150085	
309150086	
309150087	
309150088	
309150089	
309150090	Good-bye, my friend.
309151000	What is it?
309151001	
309151002	
309151003	
309151004	
309151005	
309151006	
309151007	
309151008	
309151009	
309151010	Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?
309160000	Ah, oh, you again...
309160001	
309160002	
309160003	
309160004	
309160005	
309160006	
309160007	
309160008	
309160009	
309160010	A shame you had to see me like this...
309160011	
309160012	
309160013	
309160014	
309160015	
309160016	
309160017	
309160018	
309160019	
309160020	Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all.
309160021	
309160022	
309160023	
309160024	
309160025	
309160026	
309160027	
309160028	
309160029	
309160030	I should have stuck to what I know best...
309160031	
309160032	
309160033	
309160034	
309160035	
309160036	
309160037	
309160038	
309160039	
309160040	No matter. I know I-I can trust you.
309160041	
309160042	
309160043	
309160044	
309160045	
309160046	
309160047	
309160048	
309160049	
309160050	Gullible, yes, but a good soul.
309160051	
309160052	
309160053	
309160054	
309160055	
309160056	
309160057	
309160058	
309160059	
309160060	Make certain that Tanith gets this.
309160061	
309160062	
309160063	
309160064	
309160065	
309160066	
309160067	
309160068	
309160069	
309160070	Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape.
309160071	
309160072	
309160073	
309160074	
309160075	
309160076	
309160077	
309160078	
309160079	
309160080	C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.
309161000	You're able, then?
309161001	
309161002	
309161003	
309161004	
309161005	
309161006	
309161007	
309161008	
309161009	
309161010	Then I can rest easy, my friend...
309170000	Well, well, well?
309170001	
309170002	
309170003	
309170004	
309170005	
309170006	
309170007	
309170008	
309170009	
309170010	Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?
309170011	
309170012	
309170013	
309170014	
309170015	
309170016	
309170017	
309170018	
309170019	
309170020	You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!
309170021	
309170022	
309170023	
309170024	
309170025	
309170026	
309170027	
309170028	
309170029	
309170030	Cough up your coin, all of it!
309171000	Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you?
309171001	
309171002	
309171003	
309171004	
309171005	
309171006	
309171007	
309171008	
309171009	
309171010	Oh, cripes, please, wait!
309171011	
309171012	
309171013	
309171014	
309171015	
309171016	
309171017	
309171018	
309171019	
309171020	I surrender! I surrender, I swear!
309172000	Do you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear!
309172001	
309172002	
309172003	
309172004	
309172005	
309172006	
309172007	
309172008	
309172009	
309172010	No one likes a bull-headed brute!
309172011	
309172012	
309172013	
309172014	
309172015	
309172016	
309172017	
309172018	
309172019	
309172020	You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?
309173000	Cripes! Are you dense, mate?
309173001	
309173002	
309173003	
309173004	
309173005	
309173006	
309173007	
309173008	
309173009	
309173010	What in the world has gotten into you!
309173011	
309173012	
309173013	
309173014	
309173015	
309173016	
309173017	
309173018	
309173019	
309173020	Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.
309173021	
309173022	
309173023	
309173024	
309173025	
309173026	
309173027	
309173028	
309173029	
309173030	Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!
309174000	Well, glad to see we're on the same page.
309174001	
309174002	
309174003	
309174004	
309174005	
309174006	
309174007	
309174008	
309174009	
309174010	I'd never cross you, not even close.
309174011	
309174012	
309174013	
309174014	
309174015	
309174016	
309174017	
309174018	
309174019	
309174020	He he he...
309175000	Ahhh...
309175001	
309175002	
309175003	
309175004	
309175005	
309175006	
309175007	
309175008	
309175009	
309175010	It's been ages since I've seen you.
309175011	
309175012	
309175013	
309175014	
309175015	
309175016	
309175017	
309175018	
309175019	
309175020	I didn't even realise it was you.
309175021	
309175022	
309175023	
309175024	
309175025	
309175026	
309175027	
309175028	
309175029	
309175030	Took you for a demi-human, or some such.
309175031	
309175032	
309175033	
309175034	
309175035	
309175036	
309175037	
309175038	
309175039	
309175040	You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.
309175041	
309175042	
309175043	
309175044	
309175045	
309175046	
309175047	
309175048	
309175049	
309175050	Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?
309176000	Hell's bells...
309176001	
309176002	
309176003	
309176004	
309176005	
309176006	
309176007	
309176008	
309176009	
309176010	This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...
309176011	
309176012	
309176013	
309176014	
309176015	
309176016	
309176017	
309176018	
309176019	
309176020	Especially if we keep running into the likes of you...
309176021	
309176022	
309176023	
309176024	
309176025	
309176026	
309176027	
309176028	
309176029	
309176030	...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...
309177000	...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...
309190000	Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time.
309190001	
309190002	
309190003	
309190004	
309190005	
309190006	
309190007	
309190008	
309190009	
309190010	For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium.
309190011	
309190012	
309190013	
309190014	
309190015	
309190016	
309190017	
309190018	
309190019	
309190020	Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!
309191000	Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.
309192000	Cheers for that.
309193000	What, do I have to beg?
309193001	
309193002	
309193003	
309193004	
309193005	
309193006	
309193007	
309193008	
309193009	
309193010	Give us a coin or two next time around, will you?
309194000	Forgot something on your shopping list?
309194001	
309194002	
309194003	
309194004	
309194005	
309194006	
309194007	
309194008	
309194009	
309194010	No trouble to me.
309200000	Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it.
309200001	
309200002	
309200003	
309200004	
309200005	
309200006	
309200007	
309200008	
309200009	
309200010	But, er, I'm alright, thanks.
309200011	
309200012	
309200013	
309200014	
309200015	
309200016	
309200017	
309200018	
309200019	
309200020	As my dear nan used to say, "there's no such thing as a free lunch"...
309201000	...
309800000	Ngh!
309801000	What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!
309802000	What's wrong with you?
309802001	
309802002	
309802003	
309802004	
309802005	
309802006	
309802007	
309802008	
309802009	
309802010	It's me, Patches. Patches!
309802011	
309802012	
309802013	
309802014	
309802015	
309802016	
309802017	
309802018	
309802019	
309802020	Enough now, stop!
309803000	Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we?
309804000	Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming!
309804001	
309804002	
309804003	
309804004	
309804005	
309804006	
309804007	
309804008	
309804009	
309804010	Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!
309806000	Last chance to surrender, mate.
309806001	
309806002	
309806003	
309806004	
309806005	
309806006	
309806007	
309806008	
309806009	
309806010	Grovel...and I'll forgive you.
309810000	Well... It was bound to happen some day...
309810001	
309810002	
309810003	
309810004	
309810005	
309810006	
309810007	
309810008	
309810009	
309810010	What a shit show...
309820010	Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.
309821010	There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.
309830000	Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.
309830001	
309830002	
309830003	
309830004	
309830005	
309830006	
309830007	
309830008	
309830009	
309830010	...
309830011	
309830012	
309830013	
309830014	
309830015	
309830016	
309830017	
309830018	
309830019	
309830020	Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?
309830021	
309830022	
309830023	
309830024	
309830025	
309830026	
309830027	
309830028	
309830029	
309830030	We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.
309830031	
309830032	
309830033	
309830034	
309830035	
309830036	
309830037	
309830038	
309830039	
309830040	So, what can I do you for today?
309840000	Okay, I can see you mean it.
309840001	
309840002	
309840003	
309840004	
309840005	
309840006	
309840007	
309840008	
309840009	
309840010	Consider it water under the bridge.
309840011	
309840012	
309840013	
309840014	
309840015	
309840016	
309840017	
309840018	
309840019	
309840020	A momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.
309841000	So. Do you need something from me?
309900000	 
309900001	
309900002	
309900003	
309900004

309900006	
309900007	
309900008

309900017	
309900018	
309900019	
309900020	 
310001000	Hello? Is somebody there?
310001001	
310001002	
310001003	
310001004	
310001005	
310001006	
310001007	
310001008	
310001009	
310001010	Might I bend your ear for a moment, please.
310001011	
310001012	
310001013	
310001014	
310001015	
310001016	
310001017	
310001018	
310001019	
310001020	My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south.
310001021	
310001022	
310001023	
310001024	
310001025	
310001026	
310001027	
310001028	
310001029	
310001030	The servants there...have rebelled.
310001031	
310001032	
310001033	
310001034	
310001035	
310001036	
310001037	
310001038	
310001039	
310001040	I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see...
310001041	
310001042	
310001043	
310001044	
310001045	
310001046	
310001047	
310001048	
310001049	
310001050	But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.
310001051	
310001052	
310001053	
310001054	
310001055	
310001056	
310001057	
310001058	
310001059	
310001060	My good father secreted me out the castle,
310001061	
310001062	
310001063	
310001064	
310001065	
310001066	
310001067	
310001068	
310001069	
310001070	but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander.
310002000	I understand.
310002001	
310002002	
310002003	
310002004	
310002005	
310002006	
310002007	
310002008	
310002009	
310002010	I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby.
310002011	
310002012	
310002013	
310002014	
310002015	
310002016	
310002017	
310002018	
310002019	
310002020	Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition.
310002021	
310002022	
310002023	
310002024	
310002025	
310002026	
310002027	
310002028	
310002029	
310002030	And if you happen to change your mind...
310002031	
310002032	
310002033	
310002034	
310002035	
310002036	
310002037	
310002038	
310002039	
310002040	Please come to see me again.
310003000	Hello? Is somebody there?
310003001	
310003002	
310003003	
310003004	
310003005	
310003006	
310003007	
310003008	
310003009	
310003010	Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you?
310003011	
310003012	
310003013	
310003014	
310003015	
310003016	
310003017	
310003018	
310003019	
310003020	Please, I implore you.
310003021	
310003022	
310003023	
310003024	
310003025	
310003026	
310003027	
310003028	
310003029	
310003030	Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?
310003031	
310003032	
310003033	
310003034	
310003035	
310003036	
310003037	
310003038	
310003039	
310003040	My sole wish is that he escape,\neven if his honour should be the price.
310003041	
310003042	
310003043	
310003044	
310003045	
310003046	
310003047	
310003048	
310003049	
310003050	Please...I just need him to be safe...
310004000	Thank you, dearly.
310004001	
310004002	
310004003	
310004004	
310004005	
310004006	
310004007	
310004008	
310004009	
310004010	Then please, take this.
310004011	
310004012	
310004013	
310004014	
310004015	
310004016	
310004017	
310004018	
310004019	
310004020	...
310004021	
310004022	
310004023	
310004024	
310004025	
310004026	
310004027	
310004028	
310004029	
310004030	Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.
310005000	Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.
310005001	
310005002	
310005003	
310005004	
310005005	
310005006	
310005007	
310005008	
310005009	
310005010	He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.
310006000	I...I fear for father's life.
310006001	
310006002	
310006003	
310006004	
310006005	
310006006	
310006007	
310006008	
310006009	
310006010	The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us.
310006011	
310006012	
310006013	
310006014	
310006015	
310006016	
310006017	
310006018	
310006019	
310006020	They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.\nThey haven't spared a soul.
310006021	
310006022	
310006023	
310006024	
310006025	
310006026	
310006027	
310006028	
310006029	
310006030	I fear it's no different at Castle Morne...
310006031	
310006032	
310006033	
310006034	
310006035	
310006036	
310006037	
310006038	
310006039	
310006040	Please, I implore you.
310006041	
310006042	
310006043	
310006044	
310006045	
310006046	
310006047	
310006048	
310006049	
310006050	Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?
310006051	
310006052	
310006053	
310006054	
310006055	
310006056	
310006057	
310006058	
310006059	
310006060	My sole wish is that he escape,\neven if his honour should be the price.
310006061	
310006062	
310006063	
310006064	
310006065	
310006066	
310006067	
310006068	
310006069	
310006070	Please...I just want him to be safe...
310010000	Hello? Is someone there?
310010001	
310010002	
310010003	
310010004	
310010005	
310010006	
310010007	
310010008	
310010009	
310010010	My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light.
310010011	
310010012	
310010013	
310010014	
310010015	
310010016	
310010017	
310010018	
310010019	
310010020	If I might be so bold as to ask...
310010021	
310010022	
310010023	
310010024	
310010025	
310010026	
310010027	
310010028	
310010029	
310010030	Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?
310010031	
310010032	
310010033	
310010034	
310010035	
310010036	
310010037	
310010038	
310010039	
310010040	My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see.\nI can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next.
310010041	
310010042	
310010043	
310010044	
310010045	
310010046	
310010047	
310010048	
310010049	
310010050	But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light\nin the back of my eyes.
310010070	It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden.
310011000	Hello? Is someone there?
310011001	
310011002	
310011003	
310011004	
310011005	
310011006	
310011007	
310011008	
310011009	
310011010	Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?
310011011	
310011012	
310011013	
310011014	
310011015	
310011016	
310011017	
310011018	
310011019	
310011020	I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light.
310011021	
310011022	
310011023	
310011024	
310011025	
310011026	
310011027	
310011028	
310011029	
310011030	And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light\nin the back of my eyes.
310012000	Oh, many thanks to you.
310012001	
310012002	
310012003	
310012004	
310012005	
310012006	
310012007	
310012008	
310012009	
310012010	Now I can feel the distant light once more.
310012011	
310012012	
310012013	
310012014	
310012015	
310012016	
310012017	
310012018	
310012019	
310012020	You are most kind, indeed.
310012021	
310012022	
310012023	
310012024	
310012025	
310012026	
310012027	
310012028	
310012029	
310012030	May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
310013000	You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...
310013001	
310013002	
310013003	
310013004	
310013005	
310013006	
310013007	
310013008	
310013009	
310013010	They rest their trembling hands upon me.
310013011	
310013012	
310013013	
310013014	
310013015	
310013016	
310013017	
310013018	
310013019	
310013020	Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes.
310013021	
310013022	
310013023	
310013024	
310013025	
310013026	
310013027	
310013028	
310013029	
310013030	Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes.
310013031	
310013032	
310013033	
310013034	
310013035	
310013036	
310013037	
310013038	
310013039	
310013040	But you...seem somehow...firmer.
310014000	Oh, many thanks to you.
310014001	
310014002	
310014003	
310014004	
310014005	
310014006	
310014007	
310014008	
310014009	
310014010	Now I can feel the distant light once more.
310014011	
310014012	
310014013	
310014014	
310014015	
310014016	
310014017	
310014018	
310014019	
310014020	That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are?
310014021	
310014022	
310014023	
310014024	
310014025	
310014026	
310014027	
310014028	
310014029	
310014030	Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...
310014031	
310014032	
310014033	
310014034	
310014035	
310014036	
310014037	
310014038	
310014039	
310014040	What a sight they must be to behold.
310015000	N-No... That's not possible...
310015001	
310015002	
310015003	
310015004	
310015005	
310015006	
310015007	
310015008	
310015009	
310015010	Not all of those people... Their own...
310015011	
310015012	
310015013	
310015014	
310015015	
310015016	
310015017	
310015018	
310015019	
310015020	So those noises I heard were...
310015021	
310015022	
310015023	
310015024	
310015025	
310015026	
310015027	
310015028	
310015029	
310015030	...
310015031	
310015032	
310015033	
310015034	
310015035	
310015036	
310015037	
310015038	
310015039	
310015040	<retching>
310015041	
310015042	
310015043	
310015044	
310015045	
310015046	
310015047	
310015048	
310015049	
310015050	Sorry... I'm alright now.
310015051	
310015052	
310015053	
310015054	
310015055	
310015056	
310015057	
310015058	
310015059	
310015060	Don't mind me...
310016000	...
310017000	Ah, is that you over there?
310017001	
310017002	
310017003	
310017004	
310017005	
310017006	
310017007	
310017008	
310017009	
310017010	I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.
310017011	
310017012	
310017013	
310017014	
310017015	
310017016	
310017017	
310017018	
310017019	
310017020	The reason why it was eyes I had to eat.
310017021	
310017022	
310017023	
310017024	
310017025	
310017026	
310017027	
310017028	
310017029	
310017030	The distant light is far and frail.
310017031	
310017032	
310017033	
310017034	
310017035	
310017036	
310017037	
310017038	
310017039	
310017040	So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye.
310017041	
310017042	
310017043	
310017044	
310017045	
310017046	
310017047	
310017048	
310017049	
310017050	But with everyone's eyes together, it appears.
310017051	
310017052	
310017053	
310017054	
310017055	
310017056	
310017057	
310017058	
310017059	
310017060	Finally, it all makes sense.
310017061	
310017062	
310017063	
310017064	
310017065	
310017066	
310017067	
310017068	
310017069	
310017070	I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.
310019000	You are most kind, indeed.
310019001	
310019002	
310019003	
310019004	
310019005	
310019006	
310019007	
310019008	
310019009	
310019010	May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
310020000	You are most kind, indeed.
310020001	
310020002	
310020003	
310020004	
310020005	
310020006	
310020007	
310020008	
310020009	
310020010	May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
310021000	I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes?
310021001	
310021002	
310021003	
310021004	
310021005	
310021006	
310021007	
310021008	
310021009	
310021010	Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...
310021011	
310021012	
310021013	
310021014	
310021015	
310021016	
310021017	
310021018	
310021019	
310021020	What a sight they must be to behold.
310022000	I apologise. You only did as I asked.
310022001	
310022002	
310022003	
310022004	
310022005	
310022006	
310022007	
310022008	
310022009	
310022010	I'll be fine. Think no more of it.
310023000	I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.
310023001	
310023002	
310023003	
310023004	
310023005	
310023006	
310023007	
310023008	
310023009	
310023010	I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.
310030000	Oh hello, is that you over there?
310030001	
310030002	
310030003	
310030004	
310030005	
310030006	
310030007	
310030008	
310030009	
310030010	Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes?
310030011	
310030012	
310030013	
310030014	
310030015	
310030016	
310030017	
310030018	
310030019	
310030020	They're special grapes which only grow on those\nwho've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...
310030021	
310030022	
310030023	
310030024	
310030025	
310030026	
310030027	
310030028	
310030029	
310030030	I would truly love to try one...
310030031	
310030032	
310030033	
310030034	
310030035	
310030036	
310030037	
310030038	
310030039	
310030040	The distant light seems far closer than before,
310030041	
310030042	
310030043	
310030044	
310030045	
310030046	
310030047	
310030048	
310030049	
310030050	But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore...
310030051	
310030052	
310030053	
310030054	
310030055	
310030056	
310030057	
310030058	
310030059	
310030060	Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?
310030061	
310030062	
310030063	
310030064	
310030065	
310030066	
310030067	
310030068	
310030069	
310030070	Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.
310031000	Oh, Oh!
310031001	
310031002	
310031003	
310031004	
310031005	
310031006	
310031007	
310031008	
310031009	
310031010	A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape!
310031011	
310031012	
310031013	
310031014	
310031015	
310031016	
310031017	
310031018	
310031019	
310031020	Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns...
310031021	
310031022	
310031023	
310031024	
310031025	
310031026	
310031027	
310031028	
310031029	
310031030	Thank you. I've composed myself again.
310031031	
310031032	
310031033	
310031034	
310031035	
310031036	
310031037	
310031038	
310031039	
310031040	May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
310032000	Oh, that's right.
310032001	
310032002	
310032003	
310032004	
310032005	
310032006	
310032007	
310032008	
310032009	
310032010	...Might I ask a boon of you?
310032011	
310032012	
310032013	
310032014	
310032015	
310032016	
310032017	
310032018	
310032019	
310032020	Look after this for me, if you please.
310032021	
310032022	
310032023	
310032024	
310032025	
310032026	
310032027	
310032028	
310032029	
310032030	It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it,\nbut I've been looking for its owner.
310032031	
310032032	
310032033	
310032034	
310032035	
310032036	
310032037	
310032038	
310032039	
310032040	Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home.
310032041	
310032042	
310032043	
310032044	
310032045	
310032046	
310032047	
310032048	
310032049	
310032050	Which is why I'd like you to have it.
310032051	
310032052	
310032053	
310032054	
310032055	
310032056	
310032057	
310032058	
310032059	
310032060	It must be very, very precious indeed.
310033000	They're special grapes which only grow on those\nwho've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...
310033001	
310033002	
310033003	
310033004	
310033005	
310033006	
310033007	
310033008	
310033009	
310033010	Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?
310033011	
310033012	
310033013	
310033014	
310033015	
310033016	
310033017	
310033018	
310033019	
310033020	Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.
310034000	Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
310034001	
310034002	
310034003	
310034004	
310034005	
310034006	
310034007	
310034008	
310034009	
310034010	I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.
310040000	Ah, so you're here as well, are you?
310040001	
310040002	
310040003	
310040004	
310040005	
310040006	
310040007	
310040008	
310040009	
310040010	...I realised as we've talked.
310040011	
310040012	
310040013	
310040014	
310040015	
310040016	
310040017	
310040018	
310040019	
310040020	I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord.
310040021	
310040022	
310040023	
310040024	
310040025	
310040026	
310040027	
310040028	
310040029	
310040030	Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.
310040031	
310040032	
310040033	
310040034	
310040035	
310040036	
310040037	
310040038	
310040039	
310040040	It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.
310040041	
310040042	
310040043	
310040044	
310040045	
310040046	
310040047	
310040048	
310040049	
310040050	May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.
310041000	Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.
310041001	
310041002	
310041003	
310041004	
310041005	
310041006	
310041007	
310041008	
310041009	
310041010	It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.
310050000	Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you.
310050001	
310050002	
310050003	
310050004	
310050005	
310050006	
310050007	
310050008	
310050009	
310050010	Could you please rest your hand upon me?
310050011	
310050012	
310050013	
310050014	
310050015	
310050016	
310050017	
310050018	
310050019	
310050020	Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...
310051000	Oh, it burns...
310051001	
310051002	
310051003	
310051004	
310051005	
310051006	
310051007	
310051008	
310051009	
310051010	My eyes, my eyes, they're melting...
310051011	
310051012	
310051013	
310051014	
310051015	
310051016	
310051017	
310051018	
310051019	
310051020	Aaargh!
310051021	
310051022	
310051023	
310051024	
310051025	
310051026	
310051027	
310051028	
310051029	
310051030	...
310052000	Could you please rest your hand upon me?
310052001	
310052002	
310052003	
310052004	
310052005	
310052006	
310052007	
310052008	
310052009	
310052010	Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...
310053000	...
310053001	
310053002	
310053003	
310053004	
310053005	
310053006	
310053007	
310053008	
310053009	
310053010	Thank...thank you...
310053011	
310053012	
310053013	
310053014	
310053015	
310053016	
310053017	
310053018	
310053019	
310053020	I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers.
310053021	
310053022	
310053023	
310053024	
310053025	
310053026	
310053027	
310053028	
310053029	
310053030	As your maiden, allow me to divine them.
310053031	
310053032	
310053033	
310053034	
310053035	
310053036	
310053037	
310053038	
310053039	
310053040	All that there is came from the One Great.
310053041	
310053042	
310053043	
310053044	
310053045	
310053046	
310053047	
310053048	
310053049	
310053050	Then came fractures, and births, and souls.
310053051	
310053052	
310053053	
310053054	
310053055	
310053056	
310053057	
310053058	
310053059	
310053060	But the Greater Will made a mistake.
310053061	
310053062	
310053063	
310053064	
310053065	
310053066	
310053067	
310053068	
310053069	
310053070	Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse.
310053071	
310053072	
310053073	
310053074	
310053075	
310053076	
310053077	
310053078	
310053079	
310053080	Every one, born of the mistake.
310053081	
310053082	
310053083	
310053084	
310053085	
310053086	
310053087	
310053088	
310053089	
310053090	And so, what was borrowed must be returned.
310053091	
310053092	
310053093	
310053094	
310053095	
310053096	
310053097	
310053098	
310053099	
310053100	Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame.
310053101	
310053102	
310053103	
310053104	
310053105	
310053106	
310053107	
310053108	
310053109	
310053110	Until all is One again.
310054000	Those who gave me grapes howled without words.
310054001	
310054002	
310054003	
310054004	
310054005	
310054006	
310054007	
310054008	
310054009	
310054010	Saying they wished they were never born.
310054011	
310054012	
310054013	
310054014	
310054015	
310054016	
310054017	
310054018	
310054019	
310054020	Become their lord.
310054021	
310054022	
310054023	
310054024	
310054025	
310054026	
310054027	
310054028	
310054029	
310054030	Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse.
310054031	
310054032	
310054033	
310054034	
310054035	
310054036	
310054037	
310054038	
310054039	
310054040	And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.
310054041	
310054042	
310054043	
310054044	
310054045	
310054046	
310054047	
310054048	
310054049	
310054050	No more fractures. No more birth...
310054051	
310054052	
310054053	
310054054	
310054055	
310054056	
310054057	
310054058	
310054059	
310054060	...
310800000	Agh!
310801000	What's happened to you?
310801001	
310801002	
310801003	
310801004	
310801005	
310801006	
310801007	
310801008	
310801009	
310801010	Please, you must stop this.
310802000	Ah, why on earth?
310802001	
310802002	
310802003	
310802004	
310802005	
310802006	
310802007	
310802008	
310802009	
310802010	I do not wish to cause anyone harm.
310803000	Oh, bless the stars.
310803001	
310803002	
310803003	
310803004	
310803005	
310803006	
310803007	
310803008	
310803009	
310803010	You've chosen to reconsider.
310804000	Father...
310804001	
310804002	
310804003	
310804004	
310804005	
310804006	
310804007	
310804008	
310804009	
310804010	Please, be safe...
310805000	Ahh, the distant light...fades...
310805001	
310805002	
310805003	
310805004	
310805005	
310805006	
310805007	
310805008	
310805009	
310805010	I'm so sorry, my dears...
310900000	 
310900001	
310900002	
310900003	
310900004	
310900005	
310900006	
310900007	
310900008	
310900009	
310900010	 
311001000	Ah, there's a face I've not seen before.
311001001	
311001002	
311001003	
311001004	
311001005	
311001006	
311001007	
311001008	
311001009	
311001010	I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself.
311001011	
311001012	
311001013	
311001014	
311001015	
311001016	
311001017	
311001018	
311001019	
311001020	But you can see how things have turned out.
311001021	
311001022	
311001023	
311001024	
311001025	
311001026	
311001027	
311001028	
311001029	
311001030	The menials have all rebelled.
311001031	
311001032	
311001033	
311001034	
311001035	
311001036	
311001037	
311001038	
311001039	
311001040	They gave me good service, or so I thought,\nbut it seems it was all an act.
311001041	
311001042	
311001043	
311001044	
311001045	
311001046	
311001047	
311001048	
311001049	
311001050	Foul creatures, as it's said.\nAnd true enough they're foul inside and out.
311001051	
311001052	
311001053	
311001054	
311001055	
311001056	
311001057	
311001058	
311001059	
311001060	I'm sorry to disappoint you,
311001061	
311001062	
311001063	
311001064	
311001065	
311001066	
311001067	
311001068	
311001069	
311001070	But whatever you've come here to do,\nI'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer.
311001071	
311001072	
311001073	
311001074	
311001075	
311001076	
311001077	
311001078	
311001079	
311001080	Take this, by way of apology.
311002000	Now then, away with you.
311002001	
311002002	
311002003	
311002004	
311002005	
311002006	
311002007	
311002008	
311002009	
311002010	You've no reason to risk your neck dawdling here, eh.
311003000	I see, from Irina...
311003001	
311003002	
311003003	
311003004	
311003005	
311003006	
311003007	
311003008	
311003009	
311003010	Thank you. I'm in your debt.
311003011	
311003012	
311003013	
311003014	
311003015	
311003016	
311003017	
311003018	
311003019	
311003020	But I can't leave yet.
311003021	
311003022	
311003023	
311003024	
311003025	
311003026	
311003027	
311003028	
311003029	
311003030	Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain.
311003031	
311003032	
311003033	
311003034	
311003035	
311003036	
311003037	
311003038	
311003039	
311003040	To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.
311004000	If you see Irina, do tell her.
311004001	
311004002	
311004003	
311004004	
311004005	
311004006	
311004007	
311004008	
311004009	
311004010	That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.
311010000	I'm in your debt.
311010001	
311010002	
311010003	
311010004	
311010005	
311010006	
311010007	
311010008	
311010009	
311010010	For keeping the sword from those fallen creatures.
311010011	
311010012	
311010013	
311010014	
311010015	
311010016	
311010017	
311010018	
311010019	
311010020	I'm no longer bound by duty.
311010021	
311010022	
311010023	
311010024	
311010025	
311010026	
311010027	
311010028	
311010029	
311010030	Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her.
311011000	Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina.
311011001	
311011002	
311011003	
311011004	
311011005	
311011006	
311011007	
311011008	
311011009	
311011010	And devote my remaining days to her.
311011011	
311011012	
311011013	
311011014	
311011015	
311011016	
311011017	
311011018	
311011019	
311011020	Irina has a gentle nature, though.
311011021	
311011022	
311011023	
311011024	
311011025	
311011026	
311011027	
311011028	
311011029	
311011030	I only hope it remains intact.
311020000	Irina...
311020001	
311020002	
311020003	
311020004	
311020005	
311020006	
311020007	
311020008	
311020009	
311020010	How could this be…
311020011	
311020012	
311020013	
311020014	
311020015	
311020016	
311020017	
311020018	
311020019	
311020020	My daughter deserved better…
311020021	
311020022	
311020023	
311020024	
311020025	
311020026	
311020027	
311020028	
311020029	
311020030	The fault lies...with me.
311020031	
311020032	
311020033	
311020034	
311020035	
311020036	
311020037	
311020038	
311020039	
311020040	I chose duty over my daughter's safety.
311020041	
311020042	
311020043	
311020044	
311020045	
311020046	
311020047	
311020048	
311020049	
311020050	And that is how fate has answered…
311021000	I'll find them.
311021001	
311021002	
311021003	
311021004	
311021005	
311021006	
311021007	
311021008	
311021009	
311021010	The foul wretches responsible for this.
311021011	
311021012	
311021013	
311021014	
311021015	
311021016	
311021017	
311021018	
311021019	
311021020	I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them.
311021021	
311021022	
311021023	
311021024	
311021025	
311021026	
311021027	
311021028	
311021029	
311021030	Rest assured, Irina. It will be done.
311800000	Ugh!
311801000	What's this about?
311801001	
311801002	
311801003	
311801004	
311801005	
311801006	
311801007	
311801008	
311801009	
311801010	We need not fight, I assure you.
311802000	I haven't a clue what's got into you,
311802001	
311802002	
311802003	
311802004	
311802005	
311802006	
311802007	
311802008	
311802009	
311802010	but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!
311803000	And now even your ilk have complicated matters.
311804000	Please, enlighten me.
311804001	
311804002	
311804003	
311804004	
311804005	
311804006	
311804007	
311804008	
311804009	
311804010	What was the purpose of such folly?
311805010	Please forgive me, Lord Godrick.
311806000	No, not here, not yet…
311806001	
311806002	
311806003	
311806004	
311806005	
311806006	
311806007	
311806008	
311806009	
311806010	Forgive me, Iri…na…
311810000	Ugh!
311811000	What's the matter?
311811001	
311811002	
311811003	
311811004	
311811005	
311811006	
311811007	
311811008	
311811009	
311811010	Cease this at once.
311812000	Ah, now I see!
311812001	
311812002	
311812003	
311812004	
311812005	
311812006	
311812007	
311812008	
311812009	
311812010	You had a hand in Irina's undoing!
311812011	
311812012	
311812013	
311812014	
311812015	
311812016	
311812017	
311812018	
311812019	
311812020	What could she have done to deserve that?
311813010	I will not rest until they are eliminated.
311814000	Forgive me, Irina…
311814001	
311814002	
311814003	
311814004	
311814005	
311814006	
311814007	
311814008	
311814009	
311814010	I will join you soon enough…

311920024	
311920025	
311920026	
311920027	
311920028	
311920029	
311920030	 
312001000	Oh, Tarnished, are you?
312001001	
312001002	
312001003	
312001004	
312001005	
312001006	
312001007	
312001008	
312001009	
312001010	How did you slip inside, with the gate closed?
312001011	
312001012	
312001013	
312001014	
312001015	
312001016	
312001017	
312001018	
312001019	
312001020	Hmph. No matter.
312001021	
312001022	
312001023	
312001024	
312001025	
312001026	
312001027	
312001028	
312001029	
312001030	If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book.
312001031	
312001032	
312001033	
312001034	
312001035	
312001036	
312001037	
312001038	
312001039	
312001040	I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness.
312001041	
312001042	
312001043	
312001044	
312001045	
312001046	
312001047	
312001048	
312001049	
312001050	Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time?
312001051	
312001052	
312001053	
312001054	
312001055	
312001056	
312001057	
312001058	
312001059	
312001060	Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished.
312001061	
312001062	
312001063	
312001064	
312001065	
312001066	
312001067	
312001068	
312001069	
312001070	But when the stars align, we celebrate.
312001071	
312001072	
312001073	
312001074	
312001075	
312001076	
312001077	
312001078	
312001079	
312001080	A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn,
312001081	
312001082	
312001083	
312001084	
312001085	
312001086	
312001087	
312001088	
312001089	
312001090	the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.
312002000	Well, good.
312002001	
312002002	
312002003	
312002004	
312002005	
312002006	
312002007	
312002008	
312002009	
312002010	As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors.
312002011	
312002012	
312002013	
312002014	
312002015	
312002016	
312002017	
312002018	
312002019	
312002020	Then all you need is a little patience.
312002021	
312002022	
312002023	
312002024	
312002025	
312002026	
312002027	
312002028	
312002029	
312002030	When the stars align, the festival will be declared.
312003000	Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum?
312003001	
312003002	
312003003	
312003004	
312003005	
312003006	
312003007	
312003008	
312003009	
312003010	No matter. One day you will see.
312003011	
312003012	
312003013	
312003014	
312003015	
312003016	
312003017	
312003018	
312003019	
312003020	That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.
312004000	Have patience, mm.
312004001	
312004002	
312004003	
312004004	
312004005	
312004006	
312004007	
312004008	
312004009	
312004010	When the stars align, the festival will be declared.
312005000	Go on, now.
312005001	
312005002	
312005003	
312005004	
312005005	
312005006	
312005007	
312005008	
312005009	
312005010	This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.
312006000	One day you will see, chum.
312006001	
312006002	
312006003	
312006004	
312006005	
312006006	
312006007	
312006008	
312006009	
312006010	That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.
312007000	Go on, now.
312007001	
312007002	
312007003	
312007004	
312007005	
312007006	
312007007	
312007008	
312007009	
312007010	This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.
312020000	Well, I haven't heard that name in an age.
312020001	
312020002	
312020003	
312020004	
312020005	
312020006	
312020007	
312020008	
312020009	
312020010	Then you must serve Princess Ranni?
312020011	
312020012	
312020013	
312020014	
312020015	
312020016	
312020017	
312020018	
312020019	
312020020	The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this:
312020021	
312020022	
312020023	
312020024	
312020025	
312020026	
312020027	
312020028	
312020029	
312020030	The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion.
312020031	
312020032	
312020033	
312020034	
312020035	
312020036	
312020037	
312020038	
312020039	
312020040	By the by… Is that old fool still hammering out weapons?
312020041	
312020042	
312020043	
312020044	
312020045	
312020046	
312020047	
312020048	
312020049	
312020050	His enormous frame, cramped in that little place...
312020051	
312020052	
312020053	
312020054	
312020055	
312020056	
312020057	
312020058	
312020059	
312020060	Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him.
312020061	
312020062	
312020063	
312020064	
312020065	
312020066	
312020067	
312020068	
312020069	
312020070	And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone.
312020071	
312020072	
312020073	
312020074	
312020075	
312020076	
312020077	
312020078	
312020079	
312020080	But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...
312030000	Champions, welcome!
312030001	
312030002	
312030003	
312030004	
312030005	
312030006	
312030007	
312030008	
312030009	
312030010	The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh!
312030011	
312030012	
312030013	
312030014	
312030015	
312030016	
312030017	
312030018	
312030019	
312030020	General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you!
312030021	
312030022	
312030023	
312030024	
312030025	
312030026	
312030027	
312030028	
312030029	
312030030	Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune!
312030031	
312030032	
312030033	
312030034	
312030035	
312030036	
312030037	
312030038	
312030039	
312030040	A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!
312031000	Are you good and prepared, young chum?
312031001	
312031002	
312031003	
312031004	
312031005	
312031006	
312031007	
312031008	
312031009	
312031010	The festival begins!
312034000	But now, we must make merry.
312034001	
312034002	
312034003	
312034004	
312034005	
312034006	
312034007	
312034008	
312034009	
312034010	O gathering of champions, the revels begin!
312034011	
312034012	
312034013	
312034014	
312034015	
312034016	
312034017	
312034018	
312034019	
312034020	The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!
312035000	You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort.
312035001	
312035002	
312035003	
312035004	
312035005	
312035006	
312035007	
312035008	
312035009	
312035010	General Radahn is there, even now.
312035011	
312035012	
312035013	
312035014	
312035015	
312035016	
312035017	
312035018	
312035019	
312035020	Divested of his wits, devouring corpses…
312035021	
312035022	
312035023	
312035024	
312035025	
312035026	
312035027	
312035028	
312035029	
312035030	And howling at the sky...
312036000	I see...
312036001	
312036002	
312036003	
312036004	
312036005	
312036006	
312036007	
312036008	
312036009	
312036010	When you are ready, come to me again.
312040000	At last, the war festival has ended.
312040001	
312040002	
312040003	
312040004	
312040005	
312040006	
312040007	
312040008	
312040009	
312040010	Brave champion, you have our gratitude.
312040011	
312040012	
312040013	
312040014	
312040015	
312040016	
312040017	
312040018	
312040019	
312040020	The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased.
312040021	
312040022	
312040023	
312040024	
312040025	
312040026	
312040027	
312040028	
312040029	
312040030	Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death.
312041000	Finally, my work is done.
312041001	
312041002	
312041003	
312041004	
312041005	
312041006	
312041007	
312041008	
312041009	
312041010	I am no longer bound to this fortress.
312041011	
312041012	
312041013	
312041014	
312041015	
312041016	
312041017	
312041018	
312041019	
312041020	I have a task in mind.
312041021	
312041022	
312041023	
312041024	
312041025	
312041026	
312041027	
312041028	
312041029	
312041030	Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand.
312041031	
312041032	
312041033	
312041034	
312041035	
312041036	
312041037	
312041038	
312041039	
312041040	May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.
312042000	It's time I went on my way.
312042001	
312042002	
312042003	
312042004	
312042005	
312042006	
312042007	
312042008	
312042009	
312042010	May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.
312050000	Ah, well met.
312050001	
312050002	
312050003	
312050004	
312050005	
312050006	
312050007	
312050008	
312050009	
312050010	I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places.
312050011	
312050012	
312050013	
312050014	
312050015	
312050016	
312050017	
312050018	
312050019	
312050020	You didn't...know Sellen, did you?
312050021	
312050022	
312050023	
312050024	
312050025	
312050026	
312050027	
312050028	
312050029	
312050030	Well, whatever the case, she's dead now.
312050031	
312050032	
312050033	
312050034	
312050035	
312050036	
312050037	
312050038	
312050039	
312050040	Just put it behind you.
312050041	
312050042	
312050043	
312050044	
312050045	
312050046	
312050047	
312050048	
312050049	
312050050	She was known as the Graven Witch.
312050051	
312050052	
312050053	
312050054	
312050055	
312050056	
312050057	
312050058	
312050059	
312050060	Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand.
312050061	
312050062	
312050063	
312050064	
312050065	
312050066	
312050067	
312050068	
312050069	
312050070	The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy.
312051000	Oh, a Tarnished, are you?
312051001	
312051002	
312051003	
312051004	
312051005	
312051006	
312051007	
312051008	
312051009	
312051010	You didn't...know Sellen, did you?
312052000	It is strange, though...
312052001	
312052002	
312052003	
312052004	
312052005	
312052006	
312052007	
312052008	
312052009	
312052010	The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled.
312052011	
312052012	
312052013	
312052014	
312052015	
312052016	
312052017	
312052018	
312052019	
312052020	I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.
312052021	
312052022	
312052023	
312052024	
312052025	
312052026	
312052027	
312052028	
312052029	
312052030	I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.
312052031	
312052032	
312052033	
312052034	
312052035	
312052036	
312052037	
312052038	
312052039	
312052040	A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.
312053000	I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.
312053001	
312053002	
312053003	
312053004	
312053005	
312053006	
312053007	
312053008	
312053009	
312053010	I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.
312053011	
312053012	
312053013	
312053014	
312053015	
312053016	
312053017	
312053018	
312053019	
312053020	A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.
312060000	My thanks, for the aid given.
312060001	
312060002	
312060003	
312060004	
312060005	
312060006	
312060007	
312060008	
312060009	
312060010	I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion.
312060011	
312060012	
312060013	
312060014	
312060015	
312060016	
312060017	
312060018	
312060019	
312060020	But I didn't know he was talking about you.
312060021	
312060022	
312060023	
312060024	
312060025	
312060026	
312060027	
312060028	
312060029	
312060030	You've helped me fulfil an old promise.
312060031	
312060032	
312060033	
312060034	
312060035	
312060036	
312060037	
312060038	
312060039	
312060040	This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
312061000	My thanks, for the aid given.
312061001	
312061002	
312061003	
312061004	
312061005	
312061006	
312061007	
312061008	
312061009	
312061010	Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display.
312061011	
312061012	
312061013	
312061014	
312061015	
312061016	
312061017	
312061018	
312061019	
312061020	You've helped me fulfil an old promise.
312061021

312061024	
312061025	
312061026	
312061027	
312061028	
312061029	
312061030	This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
312062000	My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given.
312062001	
312062002	
312062003	
312062004	
312062005	
312062006	
312062007

312062017	
312062018	
312062019	
312062020	This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
312063000	Well, I must be leaving now.
312063001	
312063002	
312063003	
312063004	
312063005	
312063006	
312063007	
312063008	
312063009	
312063010	Brave warrior, if the fates deign it...
312063011	
312063012	
312063013	
312063014	
312063015	
312063016	
312063017	
312063018	
312063019	
312063020	No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.
312064000	Well, I must be leaving now.
312064001	
312064002	
312064003	
312064004	
312064005	
312064006	
312064007	
312064008	
312064009	
312064010	If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.
312800000	Ugh!
312800001	
312800002	
312800003	
312800004	
312800005	
312800006	
312800007	
312800008	
312800009	
312800010	What's the matter with you?
312800011	
312800012	
312800013	
312800014	
312800015	
312800016	
312800017	
312800018	
312800019	
312800020	You trying to get revenge?
312801000	Very well.
312801001	
312801002	
312801003	
312801004	
312801005	
312801006	
312801007	
312801008	
312801009	
312801010	If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...
312801011	
312801012	
312801013	
312801014	
312801015	
312801016	
312801017	
312801018	
312801019	
312801020	Before you can pose a threat to Caria.
312802000	Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.
312803000	You...are a menace...
312803001	
312803002	
312803003	
312803004	
312803005	
312803006	
312803007	
312803008	
312803009	
312803010	Iji...beware...
312804000	Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.
312804001	
312804002	
312804003	
312804004	
312804005	
312804006	
312804007	
312804008	
312804009	
312804010	I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone.
312804011	
312804012	
312804013	
312804014	
312804015	
312804016	
312804017	
312804018	
312804019	
312804020	I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget.
312805000	You must be eliminated...
312900000	 
312900001	
312900002

313001000	Hello... Hello...
313001001	
313001002	
313001003	
313001004	
313001005	
313001006	
313001007	
313001008	
313001009	
313001010	Please... Over here...
313002000	Hello... Hello...
313002001	
313002002	
313002003	
313002004	
313002005	
313002006	
313002007	
313002008	
313002009	
313002010	Right over here...
313003000	Hello.
313003001	
313003002	
313003003	
313003004	
313003005	
313003006	
313003007	
313003008	
313003009	
313003010	It's rather chilly here, isn't it?
313003011	
313003012	
313003013	
313003014	
313003015	
313003016	
313003017	
313003018	
313003019	
313003020	My mistress sent me off on an errand...
313003021	
313003022	
313003023	
313003024	
313003025	
313003026	
313003027	
313003028	
313003029	
313003030	But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind.
313003031	
313003032	
313003033	
313003034	
313003035	
313003036	
313003037	
313003038	
313003039	
313003040	Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps?
313003041	
313003042	
313003043	
313003044	
313003045	
313003046	
313003047	
313003048	
313003049	
313003050	That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.
313003051	
313003052	
313003053	
313003054	
313003055	
313003056	
313003057	
313003058	
313003059	
313003060	I would be sure to provide ample reward.
313003061	
313003062	
313003063	
313003064	
313003065	
313003066	
313003067	
313003068	
313003069	
313003070	Only... He, too, is Tarnished.
313003071	
313003072	
313003073	
313003074	
313003075	
313003076	
313003077	
313003078	
313003079	
313003080	If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...
313004000	Ohh, thank you dearly.
313004001	
313004002	
313004003	
313004004	
313004005	
313004006	
313004007	
313004008	
313004009	
313004010	What a blessing that we've met like this.
313004011	
313004012	
313004013	
313004014	
313004015	
313004016	
313004017	
313004018	
313004019	
313004020	The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...
313004021	
313004022	
313004023	
313004024	
313004025	
313004026	
313004027	
313004028	
313004029	
313004030	Please, I must have the necklace back.
313005000	Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do.
313005001	
313005002	
313005003	
313005004	
313005005	
313005006	
313005007	
313005008	
313005009	
313005010	I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own.
313005011	
313005012	
313005013	
313005014	
313005015	
313005016	
313005017	
313005018	
313005019	
313005020	But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again.
313006000	Have you had a change of heart?
313007000	The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...
313007001	
313007002	
313007003	
313007004	
313007005	
313007006	
313007007	
313007008	
313007009	
313007010	Please, I must have the necklace back.
313010000	Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace.
313010001	
313010002	
313010003	
313010004	
313010005	
313010006	
313010007	
313010008	
313010009	
313010010	Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.
313010011	
313010012	
313010013	
313010014	
313010015	
313010016	
313010017	
313010018	
313010019	
313010020	Did I forget to announce myself?
313010021	
313010022	
313010023	
313010024	
313010025	
313010026	
313010027	
313010028	
313010029	
313010030	I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.
313010031	
313010032	
313010033	
313010034	
313010035	
313010036	
313010037	
313010038	
313010039	
313010040	I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.
313010041	
313010042	
313010043	
313010044	
313010045	
313010046	
313010047	
313010048	
313010049	
313010050	You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,
313010051	
313010052	
313010053	
313010054	
313010055	
313010056	
313010057	
313010058	
313010059	
313010060	but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.
313010061	
313010062	
313010063	
313010064	
313010065	
313010066	
313010067	
313010068	
313010069	
313010070	Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.
313010071	
313010072	
313010073	
313010074	
313010075	
313010076	
313010077	
313010078	
313010079	
313010080	Please, take this.
313010081	
313010082	
313010083	
313010084	
313010085	
313010086	
313010087	
313010088	
313010089	
313010090	Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.
313010091	
313010092	
313010093	
313010094	
313010095	
313010096	
313010097	
313010098	
313010099	
313010100	Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...
313010101	
313010102	
313010103	
313010104	
313010105	
313010106	
313010107	
313010108	
313010109	
313010110	But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,
313010111	
313010112	
313010113	
313010114	
313010115	
313010116	
313010117	
313010118	
313010119	
313010120	the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.
313011000	Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...
313011001

313011003	
313011004	
313011005	
313011006	
313011007	
313011008	
313011009	
313011010	This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.
313011011	
313011012	
313011013	
313011014	
313011015	
313011016	
313011017	
313011018	
313011019	
313011020	But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.
313011021	
313011022	
313011023	
313011024	
313011025	
313011026	
313011027	
313011028	
313011029	
313011030	Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.
313011031	
313011032	
313011033	
313011034	
313011035	
313011036	
313011037	
313011038	
313011039	
313011040	At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.
313011041	
313011042	
313011043	
313011044	
313011045	
313011046	
313011047	
313011048	
313011049	
313011050	It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.
313011051	
313011052	
313011053	
313011054	
313011055	
313011056	
313011057	
313011058	
313011059	
313011060	I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.
313011061	
313011062	
313011063	
313011064	
313011065	
313011066	
313011067	
313011068	
313011069	
313011070	I do hope that we can meet again.
313012000	I've been waiting for you.
313012001	
313012002	
313012003	
313012004	
313012005	
313012006	
313012007	
313012008	
313012009	
313012010	I knew you had the stuff of champions.
313012011	
313012012	
313012013	
313012014	
313012015	
313012016	
313012017	
313012018	
313012019	
313012020	I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.
313012021	
313012022	
313012023	
313012024	
313012025	
313012026	
313012027	
313012028	
313012029	
313012030	Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.
313012031	
313012032	
313012033	
313012034	
313012035	
313012036	
313012037	
313012038	
313012039	
313012040	I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.
313013000	I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.
313014000	Very well.
313014001	
313014002	
313014003	
313014004	
313014005	
313014006	
313014007	
313014008	
313014009	
313014010	Speak to me again once you are ready.
313014011	
313014012	
313014013	
313014014	
313014015	
313014016	
313014017	
313014018	
313014019	
313014020	You will find me here.
313015000	Are you ready, then?
313015001	
313015002	
313015003	
313015004	
313015005	
313015006	
313015007	
313015008	
313015009	
313015010	I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.
313015011	
313015012	
313015013	
313015014	
313015015	
313015016	
313015017	
313015018	
313015019	
313015020	Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.
313015021	
313015022	
313015023	
313015024	
313015025	
313015026	
313015027	
313015028	
313015029	
313015030	I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.
313016000	Give me your hand.
313016001	
313016002	
313016003	
313016004	
313016005	
313016006	
313016007	
313016008	
313016009	
313016010	I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.
313020000	Hello... Hello...
313020001	
313020002	
313020003	
313020004	
313020005	
313020006	
313020007	
313020008	
313020009	
313020010	Right over here...
313020011	
313020012	
313020013	
313020014	
313020015	
313020016	
313020017	
313020018	
313020019	
313020020	But I hardly hold him in high regard.
313020021	
313020022	
313020023	
313020024	
313020025	
313020026	
313020027	
313020028	
313020029	
313020030	He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor.
313020031	
313020032	
313020033	
313020034	
313020035	
313020036	
313020037	
313020038	
313020039	
313020040	Perhaps it is to be expected, only...
313020041	
313020042	
313020043	
313020044	
313020045	
313020046	
313020047	
313020048	
313020049	
313020050	his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it.
313020051	
313020052	
313020053	
313020054	
313020055	
313020056	
313020057	
313020058	
313020059	
313020060	Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me...
313021000	Brave Tarnished, what is your business here?
313021001	
313021002	
313021003	
313021004	
313021005	
313021006	
313021007	
313021008	
313021009	
313021010	I'm afraid this is not a guest room.
313021011	
313021012	
313021013	
313021014	
313021015	
313021016	
313021017	
313021018	
313021019	
313021020	What's that peculiar look upon your face?
313021021	
313021022	
313021023	
313021024	
313021025	
313021026	
313021027	
313021028	
313021029	
313021030	<gasp>
313021031	
313021032	
313021033	
313021034	
313021035	
313021036	
313021037	
313021038	
313021039	
313021040	Goodness, am I still a serpent?
313021041	
313021042	
313021043	
313021044	
313021045	
313021046	
313021047	
313021048	
313021049	
313021050	Oh, how dreadful...
313021051	
313021052	
313021053	
313021054	
313021055	
313021056	
313021057	
313021058	
313021059	
313021060	How dreadful indeed...
313021061	
313021062	
313021063	
313021064	
313021065	
313021066	
313021067	
313021068	
313021069	
313021070	Forgive my distress.
313021071	
313021072	
313021073	
313021074	
313021075	
313021076	
313021077	
313021078	
313021079	
313021080	I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.
313021081	
313021082	
313021083	
313021084	
313021085	
313021086	
313021087	
313021088	
313021089	
313021090	Brave Tarnished.
313021091	
313021092	
313021093	
313021094	
313021095	
313021096	
313021097	
313021098	
313021099	
313021100	This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.
313021101	
313021102	
313021103	
313021104	
313021105	
313021106	
313021107	
313021108	
313021109	
313021110	Please forgive the deception.
313021111	
313021112	
313021113	
313021114	
313021115	
313021116	
313021117	
313021118	
313021119	
313021120	Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing.
313021121	
313021122	
313021123	
313021124	
313021125	
313021126	
313021127	
313021128	
313021129	
313021130	Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.
313022000	Lady Tanith is my mother.
313022001	
313022002	
313022003	
313022004	
313022005	
313022006	
313022007	
313022008	
313022009	
313022010	I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.
313022011	
313022012	
313022013	
313022014	
313022015	
313022016	
313022017	
313022018	
313022019	
313022020	That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit.
313022021	
313022022	
313022023	
313022024	
313022025	
313022026	
313022027	
313022028	
313022029	
313022030	I am proud of what I am.
313022031	
313022032	
313022033	
313022034	
313022035	
313022036	
313022037	
313022038	
313022039	
313022040	But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me.
313022041	
313022042	
313022043	
313022044	
313022045	
313022046	
313022047	
313022048	
313022049	
313022050	And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.
313022051	
313022052	
313022053	
313022054	
313022055	
313022056	
313022057	
313022058	
313022059	
313022060	But you are not like the rest.
313023000	My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas,
313023001	
313023002	
313023003	
313023004	
313023005	
313023006	
313023007	
313023008	
313023009	
313023010	were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.
313023011	
313023012	
313023013	
313023014	
313023015	
313023016	
313023017	
313023018	
313023019	
313023020	Now I share the secrets with you, as well.
313023021	
313023022	
313023023	
313023024	
313023025	
313023026	
313023027	
313023028	
313023029	
313023030	Please keep them safe from anyone else.
313024000	Seek the old ruins in the cliff.
313024001	
313024002	
313024003	
313024004	
313024005	
313024006	
313024007	
313024008	
313024009	
313024010	At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.
313024011	
313024012	
313024013	
313024014	
313024015	
313024016	
313024017	
313024018	
313024019	
313024020	It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.
313024021	
313024022	
313024023	
313024024	
313024025	
313024026	
313024027	
313024028	
313024029	
313024030	I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.
313024031	
313024032	
313024033	
313024034	
313024035	
313024036	
313024037	
313024038	
313024039	
313024040	I do hope that we can meet again.
313030000	Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
313030001	
313030002	
313030003	
313030004	
313030005	
313030006	
313030007	
313030008	
313030009	
313030010	As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.
313030011	
313030012	
313030013	
313030014	
313030015	
313030016	
313030017	
313030018	
313030019	
313030020	Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
313031000	Have you ever...
313031001	
313031002	
313031003	
313031004	
313031005	
313031006	
313031007	
313031008	
313031009	
313031010	heard any strange sounds here at the manor?
313031011	
313031012	
313031013	
313031014	
313031015	
313031016	
313031017	
313031018	
313031019	
313031020	Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...
313031021	
313031022	
313031023	
313031024	
313031025	
313031026	
313031027	
313031028	
313031029	
313031030	Oh fie, what am I saying?
313031031	
313031032	
313031033	
313031034	
313031035	
313031036	
313031037	
313031038	
313031039	
313031040	It just isn't possible. I must be tired.
313032000	Um, oh, it's you.
313032001	
313032002	
313032003	
313032004	
313032005	
313032006	
313032007	
313032008	
313032009	
313032010	Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late.
313032011	
313032012	
313032013	
313032014	
313032015	
313032016	
313032017	
313032018	
313032019	
313032020	Hmm, well...
313032021	
313032022	
313032023	
313032024	
313032025	
313032026	
313032027	
313032028	
313032029	
313032030	I know I can trust you...
313032031	
313032032	
313032033	
313032034	
313032035	
313032036	
313032037	
313032038	
313032039	
313032040	I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night.
313032041	
313032042	
313032043	
313032044	
313032045	
313032046	
313032047	
313032048	
313032049	
313032050	It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.
313032051	
313032052	
313032053	
313032054	
313032055	
313032056	
313032057	
313032058	
313032059	
313032060	If I'm not mistaken,
313032061	
313032062	
313032063	
313032064	
313032065	
313032066	
313032067	
313032068	
313032069	
313032070	it took the form of a serpent, just like me...
313032071	
313032072	
313032073	
313032074	
313032075	
313032076	
313032077	
313032078	
313032079	
313032080	Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret,
313032081	
313032082	
313032083	
313032084	
313032085	
313032086	
313032087	
313032088	
313032089	
313032090	that Lady Tanith has kept from me?
313032091	
313032092	
313032093	
313032094	
313032095	
313032096	
313032097	
313032098	
313032099	
313032100	I realise that I shouldn't impose but,
313032101	
313032102	
313032103	
313032104	
313032105	
313032106	
313032107	
313032108	
313032109	
313032110	if you discover anything, would you please share?
313032111	
313032112	
313032113	
313032114	
313032115	
313032116	
313032117	
313032118	
313032119	
313032120	It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.
313033000	The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night...
313033001	
313033002	
313033003	
313033004	
313033005	
313033006	
313033007	
313033008	
313033009	
313033010	It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.
313033011	
313033012	
313033013	
313033014	
313033015	
313033016	
313033017	
313033018	
313033019	
313033020	Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets.
313033021	
313033022	
313033023	
313033024	
313033025	
313033026	
313033027	
313033028	
313033029	
313033030	If you discover anything, would you please share?
313033031	
313033032	
313033033	
313033034	
313033035	
313033036	
313033037	
313033038	
313033039	
313033040	It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.
313034000	Really...
313034001	
313034002	
313034003	
313034004	
313034005	
313034006	
313034007	
313034008	
313034009	
313034010	Oh, so there was a secret after all...
313034011	
313034012	
313034013	
313034014	
313034015	
313034016	
313034017	
313034018	
313034019	
313034020	Oh my...
313034021	
313034022	
313034023	
313034024	
313034025	
313034026	
313034027	
313034028	
313034029	
313034030	Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...
313034031	
313034032	
313034033	
313034034	
313034035	
313034036	
313034037	
313034038	
313034039	
313034040	Was I not...
313034041	
313034042	
313034043	
313034044	
313034045	
313034046	
313034047	
313034048	
313034049	
313034050	born by the grace of a king?
313035000	Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
313035001	
313035002	
313035003	
313035004	
313035005	
313035006	
313035007	
313035008	
313035009	
313035010	It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand,
313035011	
313035012	
313035013	
313035014	
313035015	
313035016	
313035017	
313035018	
313035019	
313035020	but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.
313035021	
313035022	
313035023	
313035024	
313035025	
313035026	
313035027	
313035028	
313035029	
313035030	Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
313036000	Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
313036001	
313036002	
313036003	
313036004	
313036005	
313036006	
313036007	
313036008	
313036009	
313036010	Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia.
313036011	
313036012	
313036013	
313036014	
313036015	
313036016	
313036017	
313036018	
313036019	
313036020	I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.
313036021	
313036022	
313036023	
313036024	
313036025	
313036026	
313036027	
313036028	
313036029	
313036030	Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
313037000	A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished.
313037001	
313037002	
313037003	
313037004	
313037005	
313037006	
313037007	
313037008	
313037009	
313037010	I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor.
313037011	
313037012	
313037013	
313037014	
313037015	
313037016	
313037017	
313037018	
313037019	
313037020	Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
313038000	Brave Tarnished.
313038001	
313038002	
313038003	
313038004	
313038005	
313038006	
313038007	
313038008	
313038009	
313038010	Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
313039000	Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls.
313039001	
313039002	
313039003	
313039004	
313039005	
313039006	
313039007	
313039008	
313039009	
313039010	Like breathing, or slithering scales.
313039011	
313039012	
313039013	
313039014	
313039015	
313039016	
313039017	
313039018	
313039019	
313039020	Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.
313040000	Hmm, what is this?
313040001	
313040002	
313040003	
313040004	
313040005	
313040006	
313040007	
313040008	
313040009	
313040010	I remember this scent, distinctly.
313040011	
313040012	
313040013	
313040014	
313040015	
313040016	
313040017	
313040018	
313040019	
313040020	...
313040021	
313040022	
313040023	
313040024	
313040025	
313040026	
313040027	
313040028	
313040029	
313040030	Funny, isn't it.
313040031	
313040032	
313040033	
313040034	
313040035	
313040036	
313040037	
313040038	
313040039	
313040040	I am certain of it. I was born inside this.
313040041	
313040042	
313040043	
313040044	
313040045	
313040046	
313040047	
313040048	
313040049	
313040050	It's a part of my birth mother.
313040051	
313040052	
313040053	
313040054	
313040055	
313040056	
313040057	
313040058	
313040059	
313040060	You have my gratitude.
313040061	
313040062	
313040063	
313040064	
313040065	
313040066	
313040067	
313040068	
313040069	
313040070	Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.
313040071	
313040072	
313040073	
313040074	
313040075	
313040076	
313040077	
313040078	
313040079	
313040080	I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.
313040081	
313040082	
313040083	
313040084	
313040085	
313040086	
313040087	
313040088	
313040089	
313040090	One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.
313041000	Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...
313041001	
313041002	
313041003	
313041004	
313041005	
313041006	
313041007	
313041008	
313041009	
313041010	Was I not...
313041011	
313041012	
313041013	
313041014	
313041015	
313041016	
313041017	
313041018	
313041019	
313041020	born by the grace of a king?
313042000	I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.
313042001	
313042002	
313042003	
313042004	
313042005	
313042006	
313042007	
313042008	
313042009	
313042010	One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.
313050000	Oh, it's you...
313050001	
313050002	
313050003	
313050004	
313050005	
313050006	
313050007	
313050008	
313050009	
313050010	I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.
313050011	
313050012	
313050013	
313050014	
313050015	
313050016	
313050017	
313050018	
313050019	
313050020	I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.
313050021	
313050022	
313050023	
313050024	
313050025	
313050026	
313050027	
313050028	
313050029	
313050030	Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents.
313050031	
313050032	
313050033	
313050034	
313050035	
313050036	
313050037	
313050038	
313050039	
313050040	Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.
313050041	
313050042	
313050043	
313050044	
313050045	
313050046	
313050047	
313050048	
313050049	
313050050	You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,
313050051	
313050052	
313050053	
313050054	
313050055	
313050056	
313050057	
313050058	
313050059	
313050060	but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.
313050061	
313050062	
313050063	
313050064	
313050065	
313050066	
313050067	
313050068	
313050069	
313050070	I know that you have done so much for me.
313050071	
313050072	
313050073	
313050074	
313050075	
313050076	
313050077	
313050078	
313050079	
313050080	But I wish to ask one last kindness.
313050081	
313050082	
313050083	
313050084	
313050085	
313050086	
313050087	
313050088	
313050089	
313050090	Kill me, please.
313050091	
313050092	
313050093	
313050094	
313050095	
313050096	
313050097	
313050098	
313050099	
313050100	I thought that I feared nothing. But this...
313050101	
313050102	
313050103	
313050104	
313050105	
313050106	
313050107	
313050108	
313050109	
313050110	Free me from this accursed frame.
313051000	Agh...
313051001	
313051002	
313051003	
313051004	
313051005	
313051006	
313051007	
313051008	
313051009	
313051010	Thank you... My champion...
313051011	
313051012	
313051013	
313051014	
313051015	
313051016	
313051017	
313051018

313051020	Mother...
313052000	I'm to drink this, then?
313052001	
313052002	
313052003	
313052004	
313052005	
313052006	
313052007	
313052008	
313052009	
313052010	Yes, of course. You always were very kind.
313052011	
313052012	
313052013	
313052014	
313052015	
313052016	
313052017	
313052018	
313052019	
313052020	...
313052021	
313052022	
313052023	
313052024	
313052025	
313052026	
313052027	
313052028	
313052029	
313052030	Ahh... How delightfully sweet...
313052031	
313052032	
313052033	
313052034	
313052035	
313052036	
313052037	
313052038	
313052039	
313052040	And yet...
313060000	I know that you have done so much for me.
313060001	
313060002	
313060003	
313060004	
313060005	
313060006	
313060007	
313060008	
313060009	
313060010	But I wish to ask one last kindness.
313060011	
313060012	
313060013	
313060014	
313060015	
313060016	
313060017	
313060018	
313060019	
313060020	Kill me, please.
313060021	
313060022	
313060023	
313060024	
313060025	
313060026	
313060027	
313060028	
313060029	
313060030	I thought that I feared nothing. But this...
313060031	
313060032	
313060033	
313060034	
313060035	
313060036	
313060037	
313060038	
313060039	
313060040	Free me from this accursed frame.
313061000	You're not willing to kill me, are you.
313061001	
313061002	
313061003	
313061004	
313061005	
313061006	
313061007	
313061008	
313061009	
313061010	Hah...
313061011	
313061012	
313061013	
313061014	
313061015	
313061016	
313061017	
313061018	
313061019	
313061020	You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.
313062000	I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts.
313062001	
313062002	
313062003	
313062004	
313062005	
313062006	
313062007	
313062008	
313062009	
313062010	How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.
313070000	...
313071000	Oh, it's you.
313071001	
313071002	
313071003	
313071004	
313071005	
313071006	
313071007	
313071008	
313071009	
313071010	Heaven knows what happened here,
313071011	
313071012	
313071013	
313071014	
313071015	
313071016	
313071017	
313071018	
313071019	
313071020	but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.
313071021	
313071022	
313071023	
313071024	
313071025	
313071026	
313071027	
313071028	
313071029	
313071030	It feels rather quiet without them.
313071031	
313071032	
313071033	
313071034	
313071035	
313071036	
313071037	
313071038	
313071039	
313071040	But with you here, things will be just fine.
313072000	I await Lady Tanith.
313072001	
313072002	
313072003	
313072004	
313072005	
313072006	
313072007	
313072008	
313072009	
313072010	I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king.
313072011	
313072012	
313072013	
313072014	
313072015	
313072016	
313072017	
313072018	
313072019	
313072020	I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.
313072021	
313072022	
313072023	
313072024	
313072025	
313072026	
313072027	
313072028	
313072029	
313072030	Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour.
313072031	
313072032	
313072033	
313072034	
313072035	
313072036	
313072037	
313072038	
313072039	
313072040	I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.
313800000	Please, stop, Brave Tarnished.
313800001	
313800002	
313800003	
313800004	
313800005	
313800006	
313800007	
313800008	
313800009	
313800010	You will only tire by striking this barrier.
313801000	Besides, I am no foe of yours.
313801001	
313801002	
313801003	
313801004	
313801005	
313801006	
313801007	
313801008	
313801009	
313801010	Please, think this over.
313802000	I see that you have reconsidered.
313802001	
313802002	
313802003	
313802004	
313802005	
313802006	
313802007	
313802008	
313802009	
313802010	Thank goodness.
313900000	 
313900100	 
314001000	Ah, hello. You must be new here.
314001001	
314001002	
314001003	
314001004	
314001005	
314001006	
314001007	
314001008	
314001009	
314001010	I'm...
314001011	
314001012	
314001013	
314001014	
314001015	
314001016	
314001017	
314001018	
314001019	
314001020	Well, just call me Diallos.
314001021	
314001022	
314001023	
314001024	
314001025	
314001026	
314001027	
314001028	
314001029	
314001030	The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.
314001031	
314001032	
314001033	
314001034	
314001035	
314001036	
314001037	
314001038	
314001039	
314001040	By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?
314001041	
314001042	
314001043	
314001044	
314001045	
314001046	
314001047	
314001048	
314001049	
314001050	She's my servant, but fickle as the wind.
314001051	
314001052	
314001053	
314001054	
314001055	
314001056	
314001057	
314001058	
314001059	
314001060	Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.
314001061	
314001062	
314001063	
314001064	
314001065	
314001066	
314001067	
314001068	
314001069	
314001070	If you find her, please be sure to tell me.
314002000	Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya.
314002001	
314002002	
314002003	
314002004	
314002005	
314002006	
314002007	
314002008	
314002009	
314002010	She's a servant to my house.
314002011	
314002012	
314002013	
314002014	
314002015	
314002016	
314002017	
314002018	
314002019	
314002020	She's been my companion since childhood.
314002021	
314002022	
314002023	
314002024	
314002025	
314002026	
314002027	
314002028	
314002029	
314002030	I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.
314002031	
314002032	
314002033	
314002034	
314002035	
314002036	
314002037	
314002038	
314002039	
314002040	Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.
314010000	Lanya... Lanya...
314010001	
314010002	
314010003	
314010004	
314010005	
314010006	
314010007	
314010008	
314010009	
314010010	It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you?
314011000	Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.
314011001	
314011002	
314011003

314011006	
314011007

314011017	
314011018	
314011019	
314011020	They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,\nand I refuse to let the insult stand.
314011021	
314011022	
314011023	
314011024

314011036	
314011037	
314011038	
314011039	
314011040	I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
314012000	Ah, you again, is it?
314012001	
314012002	
314012003	
314012004	
314012005	
314012006	
314012007	
314012008	
314012009	
314012010	The recusants sent a lackey.

314012014	
314012015

314012017	
314012018	
314012019	
314012020	Can you believe they invited me to join them?\nNow! After what they did...
314012021	
314012022	
314012023	
314012024	
314012025	
314012026	
314012027	
314012028	
314012029	
314012030	I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?
314012031	
314012032	
314012033	
314012034	
314012035

314012037	
314012038	
314012039	
314012040	You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.
314012041	
314012042	
314012043	
314012044	
314012045	
314012046	
314012047	
314012048	
314012049	
314012050	Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.
314012051

314012054

314012056	
314012057	
314012058	
314012059	
314012060	It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west\nfrom the town of windmills.
314012061	
314012062	
314012063

314012067

314014018	
314014019	
314014020	I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
314015000	It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west\nfrom the town of windmills.
314015001	
314015002	
314015003	
314015004	
314015005	
314015006	
314015007	
314015008	
314015009	
314015010	That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.
314015011	
314015012	
314015013	
314015014	
314015015	
314015016	
314015017	
314015018	
314015019	
314015020	Just you wait, wretched recusants.
314015021	
314015022	
314015023	
314015024	
314015025	
314015026	
314015027	
314015028	
314015029	
314015030	"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.
314020000	Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it?
314020001	
314020002	
314020003	
314020004	
314020005	
314020006	
314020007	
314020008	
314020009	
314020010	Well. Nice to see you again.
314020011	
314020012	
314020013	
314020014	
314020015	
314020016	
314020017	
314020018	
314020019	
314020020	So you've been invited as well, I see.
314020021	
314020022	
314020023	
314020024	
314020025	
314020026	
314020027	
314020028	
314020029	
314020030	Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth.\nYou watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?
314021000	I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya...
314021001	
314021002	
314021003	
314021004	
314021005	
314021006	
314021007	
314021008	
314021009	
314021010	Well, you see, I...
314021011	
314021012	
314021013	
314021014	
314021015	
314021016	
314021017	
314021018	
314021019	
314021020	After much internal debate, I've come to realise...
314021021	
314021022	
314021023	
314021024	
314021025	
314021026	
314021027	
314021028	
314021029	
314021030	Revenge is not the answer.
314021031	
314021032	
314021033	
314021034	
314021035	
314021036	
314021037	
314021038	
314021039	
314021040	According to Lady Tanith...
314021041	
314021042	
314021043	
314021044	
314021045	
314021046	
314021047	
314021048	
314021049	
314021050	I've got the stuff of champions.
314021051	
314021052	
314021053	
314021054	
314021055	
314021056	
314021057	
314021058	
314021059	
314021060	And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.
314021061	
314021062	
314021063	
314021064	
314021065	
314021066	
314021067	
314021068	
314021069	
314021070	It hit me like a bolt from the blue...
314021071	
314021072	
314021073	
314021074	
314021075	
314021076	
314021077	
314021078	
314021079	
314021080	That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.
314021081	
314021082	
314021083	
314021084	
314021085	
314021086	
314021087	
314021088	
314021089	
314021090	Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.
314021091	
314021092	
314021093	
314021094	
314021095	
314021096	
314021097	
314021098	
314021099	
314021100	That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.
314021101	
314021102	
314021103	
314021104	
314021105	
314021106	
314021107	
314021108	
314021109	
314021110	But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't\nmake me a champion, will it.
314021111	
314021112	
314021113	
314021114	
314021115	
314021116	
314021117	
314021118	
314021119	
314021120	Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.
314021121	
314021122	
314021123	
314021124	
314021125	
314021126	
314021127	
314021128	
314021129	
314021130	But such is true of any road trod by champions.
314022000	I always resented these hands.
314022001	
314022002	
314022003	
314022004	
314022005	
314022006	
314022007	
314022008	
314022009	
314022010	Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.
314022011	
314022012	
314022013	
314022014	
314022015	
314022016	
314022017	
314022018	
314022019	
314022020	But that won't be the case for long.
314022021	
314022022	
314022023	
314022024	
314022025	
314022026	
314022027	
314022028	
314022029	
314022030	They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.
314022031	
314022032	
314022033	
314022034	
314022035	
314022036	
314022037	
314022038	
314022039	
314022040	"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.
314030000	Ah, it's you, is it.
314030001	
314030002	
314030003	
314030004	
314030005	
314030006	
314030007	
314030008	
314030009	
314030010	I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself?
314030011	
314030012	
314030013	
314030014	
314030015	
314030016	
314030017	
314030018	
314030019	
314030020	I haven't achieved anything at all thus far.
314030021	
314030022	
314030023	
314030024	
314030025	
314030026	
314030027	
314030028	
314030029	
314030030	Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.
314030031	
314030032	
314030033	
314030034	
314030035	
314030036	
314030037	
314030038	
314030039	
314030040	I'm still yet to achieve anything.
314030041	
314030042	
314030043	
314030044	
314030045	
314030046	
314030047	
314030048	
314030049	
314030050	Perhaps I am a fool after all...
314030051	
314030052	
314030053	
314030054	
314030055	
314030056	
314030057	
314030058	
314030059	
314030060	No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the\npath of revenge and sullied the name of my house.
314030061	
314030062	
314030063	
314030064	
314030065	
314030066	
314030067	
314030068	
314030069	
314030070	What an easy mark I must have been...
314030071	
314030072	
314030073	
314030074	
314030075	
314030076	
314030077	
314030078	
314030079	
314030080	How did it take me so long to realise, honestly...
314030081	
314030082	
314030083	
314030084	
314030085	
314030086	
314030087	
314030088	
314030089	
314030090	There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...
314031000	It's just as my noble brother says.
314031001	
314031002	
314031003	
314031004	
314031005	
314031006	
314031007	
314031008	
314031009	
314031010	I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become\na champion.
314032000	Perhaps I am a fool after all...
314032001	
314032002	
314032003	
314032004	
314032005	
314032006	
314032007	
314032008	
314032009	
314032010	No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the\npath of revenge and sullied the name of my house.
314032011	
314032012	
314032013	
314032014	
314032015	
314032016	
314032017	
314032018	
314032019	
314032020	What an easy mark I must have been...
314040000	Well. Aren't you full of beans.
314040001	
314040002	
314040003	
314040004	
314040005	
314040006	
314040007	
314040008	
314040009	
314040010	No wonder you're covered in muck.
314041000	Oh? My friend, it's been far too long.
314041001	
314041002	
314041003	
314041004	
314041005	
314041006	
314041007	
314041008	
314041009	
314041010	I have to say you caught me at a rather low point.
314041011	
314041012	
314041013	
314041014	
314041015	
314041016	
314041017	
314041018	
314041019	
314041020	But...as you see, I've put all that behind me.
314041021	
314041022	
314041023	
314041024	
314041025	
314041026	
314041027	
314041028	
314041029	
314041030	Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now.\nMaking my own choices.
314041031	
314041032	
314041033	
314041034	
314041035	
314041036	
314041037	
314041038	
314041039	
314041040	Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars.
314041041	
314041042	
314041043	
314041044	
314041045	
314041046	
314041047	
314041048	
314041049	
314041050	Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time\nin my life I'm on the straight and narrow.
314042000	A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars.
314042001	
314042002	
314042003	
314042004	
314042005	
314042006	
314042007	
314042008	
314042009	
314042010	Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time\nin my life I'm on the straight and narrow.
314051000	...Ah, you...
314051001	
314051002	
314051003	
314051004	
314051005	
314051006	
314051007	
314051008	
314051009	
314051010	Are the jars...they alright?
314051011	
314051012	
314051013	
314051014	
314051015	
314051016	
314051017	
314051018	
314051019	
314051020	Did I defend them?
314052000	Then all is well...
314052001	
314052002	
314052003	
314052004	
314052005	
314052006	
314052007	
314052008	
314052009	
314052010	This fool proved his worth, in the end...
314053000	Ha...ha ha...
314053001	
314053002	
314053003	
314053004	
314053005	
314053006	
314053007	
314053008	
314053009	
314053010	I see... I see...
314053011	
314053012	
314053013	
314053014	
314053015	
314053016	
314053017	
314053018	
314053019	
314053020	I've been a fool...to the last...
314800000	Agh!
314800001	
314800002	
314800003	
314800004	
314800005	
314800006	
314800007	
314800008	
314800009	
314800010	What on earth was that for!
314801000	Now I see. You're a wretched recusant!
314801001	
314801002	
314801003	
314801004	
314801005	
314801006	
314801007	
314801008	
314801009	
314801010	May you rue the day that you thought to trample me!
314801011	
314801012	
314801013	
314801014	
314801015	
314801016	
314801017	
314801018	
314801019	
314801020	The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!
314801021	
314801022	
314801023	
314801024	
314801025	
314801026	
314801027	
314801028	
314801029	
314801030	In blood!
314802000	Lanya, your honour has been restored.
314802001	
314802002	
314802003	
314802004	
314802005	
314802006	
314802007	
314802008	
314802009	
314802010	You can rest easy.
314803000	Ha ha...ha...
314803001	
314803002	
314803003	
314803004	
314803005	
314803006	
314803007	
314803008	
314803009	
314803010	I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...
314810000	Ugh!
314810001	
314810002	
314810003	
314810004	
314810005

314810009	
314810010	What's the matter? Please, stop!
314810011	
314810012	
314810013	
314810014	
314810015	
314810016	
314810017	
314810018	
314810019	
314810020	I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor.
314810021	
314810022	
314810023	
314810024	
314810025	
314810026	
314810027	
314810028	
314810029	
314810030	I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!
314811000	Why on earth...?
314811001	
314811002	
314811003	
314811004	
314811005	
314811006	
314811007	
314811008	
314811009	
314811010	Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you?
314811011	
314811012	
314811013	
314811014	
314811015	
314811016	
314811017	
314811018	
314811019	
314811020	I'll turn my back on duty no more.
314811021	
314811022	
314811023	
314811024	
314811025	
314811026	
314811027	
314811028	
314811029	
314811030	The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!
314811031	
314811032	
314811033	
314811034	
314811035	
314811036	
314811037	
314811038	
314811039	
314811040	In blood!
314812000	Unharmed, thank the stars.
314813000	Ahh, just what I deserve...
314813001	
314813002	
314813003	
314813004	
314813005	
314813006	
314813007	
314813008	
314813009	
314813010	For absconding from my duties...
314813011	
314813012	
314813013	
314813014	
314813015	
314813016	
314813017	
314813018	
314813019	
314813020	I'm sorry, my dear jars...
314900000

314910018	
314910019	
314910020	 
316001000	Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.
316001001	
316001002	
316001003	
316001004	
316001005	
316001006	
316001007	
316001008	
316001009	
316001010	I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly.
316001011	
316001012	
316001013	
316001014	
316001015	
316001016	
316001017	
316001018	
316001019	
316001020	Why are you here?
316002000	Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?
316002001	
316002002	
316002003	
316002004	
316002005	
316002006	
316002007	
316002008	
316002009	
316002010	Well, your aptitude does appear...passable.
316002011	
316002012	
316002013	
316002014	
316002015	
316002016	
316002017	
316002018	
316002019	
316002020	But one must choose one's masters wisely.
316002021	
316002022	
316002023	
316002024	
316002025	
316002026	
316002027	
316002028	
316002029	
316002030	I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria,
316002031	
316002032	
316002033	
316002034	
316002035	
316002036	
316002037	
316002038	
316002039	
316002040	as a reviled, apostate witch.
316002041	
316002042	
316002043	
316002044	
316002045	
316002046	
316002047	
316002048	
316002049	
316002050	Do you still wish to learn from me?
316003000	Well, you are a piece of work.
316003001	
316003002	
316003003	
316003004	
316003005	
316003006	
316003007	
316003008	
316003009	
316003010	Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery.
316003011	
316003012	
316003013	
316003014	
316003015	
316003016	
316003017	
316003018	
316003019	
316003020	But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.
316003021	
316003022	
316003023	
316003024	
316003025	
316003026	
316003027	
316003028	
316003029	
316003030	Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.
316004000	Really.
316004001	
316004002	
316004003	
316004004	
316004005	
316004006	
316004007	
316004008	
316004009	
316004010	It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about.
316005000	What is it now? Why are you here again?
316006000	...
316006001	
316006002	
316006003	
316006004	
316006005	
316006006	
316006007	
316006008	
316006009	
316006010	You are quite the enigma, aren't you...
316007000	I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal...
316007001	
316007002	
316007003	
316007004	
316007005	
316007006	
316007007	
316007008	
316007009	
316007010	Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck.
316008000	Yes, I think that would be wise.
316008001	
316008002	
316008003	
316008004	
316008005	
316008006	
316008007	
316008008	
316008009	
316008010	We must choose our masters wisely.
316009000	Well? Have you made up your mind?
316010000	Young apprentice. First things first.
316010001	
316010002	
316010003	
316010004	
316010005	
316010006	
316010007	
316010008	
316010009	
316010010	You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.
316010011	
316010012	
316010013	
316010014	
316010015	
316010016	
316010017	
316010018	
316010019	
316010020	So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance.
316010021	
316010022	
316010023	
316010024	
316010025	
316010026	
316010027	
316010028	
316010029	
316010030	Now, shall we start learning?
316011000	There you are, my apprentice.
316011001	
316011002	
316011003	
316011004	
316011005	
316011006	
316011007	
316011008	
316011009	
316011010	Shall we commence the lesson?
316012000	You wish to continue the lesson?
316012001	
316012002	
316012003	
316012004	
316012005	
316012006	
316012007	
316012008	
316012009	
316012010	Very well, I have time aplenty.
316020000	Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone.
316020001	
316020002	
316020003	
316020004	
316020005	
316020006	
316020007	
316020008	
316020009	
316020010	But what is the nature of such power?
316020011	
316020012	
316020013	
316020014	
316020015	
316020016	
316020017	
316020018	
316020019	
316020020	Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos.
316020021	
316020022	
316020023	
316020024	
316020025	
316020026	
316020027	
316020028	
316020029	
316020030	Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality,
316020031	
316020032	
316020033	
316020034	
316020035	
316020036	
316020037	
316020038	
316020039	
316020040	while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars.
316020041	
316020042	
316020043	
316020044	
316020045	
316020046	
316020047	
316020048	
316020049	
316020050	It should not be forgotten,
316020051	
316020052	
316020053	
316020054	
316020055	
316020056	
316020057	
316020058	
316020059	
316020060	that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.
316020061	
316020062	
316020063	
316020064	
316020065	
316020066	
316020067	
316020068	
316020069	
316020070	A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days...
316021000	Your appetite for learning is impressive.
316021001	
316021002	
316021003	
316021004	
316021005	
316021006	
316021007	
316021008	
316021009	
316021010	You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.
316021011	
316021012	
316021013	
316021014	
316021015	
316021016	
316021017	
316021018	
316021019	
316021020	You must have a fabulous teacher.
316030000	Hmm? What's on your mind?
316031000	Well, well...
316031001	
316031002	
316031003	
316031004	
316031005	
316031006	
316031007	
316031008	
316031009	
316031010	Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again...
316031011	
316031012	
316031013	
316031014	
316031015	
316031016	
316031017	
316031018	
316031019	
316031020	But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge.
316031021	
316031022	
316031023	
316031024	
316031025	
316031026	
316031027	
316031028	
316031029	
316031030	The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.
316031031	
316031032	
316031033	
316031034	
316031035	
316031036	
316031037	
316031038	
316031039	
316031040	But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.
316031041	
316031042	
316031043	
316031044	
316031045	
316031046	
316031047	
316031048	
316031049	
316031050	Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.
316031051	
316031052	
316031053	
316031054	
316031055	
316031056	
316031057	
316031058	
316031059	
316031060	If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.
316031061	
316031062	
316031063	
316031064	
316031065	
316031066	
316031067	
316031068	
316031069	
316031070	And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.
316040000	My apprentice, what happened to your nail?
316040001	
316040002	
316040003	
316040004	
316040005	
316040006	
316040007	
316040008	
316040009	
316040010	Perhaps you have a different view, but...
316040011	
316040012	
316040013	
316040014	
316040015	
316040016	
316040017	
316040018	
316040019	
316040020	That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.
316040021	
316040022	
316040023	
316040024	
316040025	
316040026	
316040027	
316040028	
316040029	
316040030	May I remove it for you?
316041000	A wise choice. Let me neutralize it.
316041001	
316041002	
316041003	
316041004	
316041005	
316041006	
316041007	
316041008	
316041009	
316041010	But first...
316041011	
316041012	
316041013	
316041014	
316041015	
316041016	
316041017	
316041018	
316041019	
316041020	Listen up, wretched curse-peddler.
316041021	
316041022	
316041023	
316041024	
316041025	
316041026	
316041027	
316041028	
316041029	
316041030	This is a vile craft in which you engage.
316041031	
316041032	
316041033	
316041034	
316041035	
316041036	
316041037	
316041038	
316041039	
316041040	Let it be known.
316041041	
316041042	
316041043	
316041044	
316041045	
316041046	
316041047	
316041048	
316041049	
316041050	This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch.
316041051	
316041052	
316041053	
316041054	
316041055	
316041056	
316041057	
316041058	
316041059	
316041060	I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand.
316041061	
316041062	
316041063	
316041064	
316041065	
316041066	
316041067	
316041068	
316041069	
316041070	Your death will not be a pleasant one.
316041071	
316041072	
316041073	
316041074	
316041075	
316041076	
316041077	
316041078	
316041079	
316041080	May you shudder between breaths in your sleep...
316042000	If you prefer not, that is your prerogative.
316042001	
316042002	
316042003	
316042004	
316042005	
316042006	
316042007	
316042008	
316042009	
316042010	But let it be known.
316042011	
316042012	
316042013	
316042014	
316042015	
316042016	
316042017	
316042018	
316042019	
316042020	That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.
316042021	
316042022	
316042023	
316042024	
316042025	
316042026	
316042027	
316042028	
316042029	
316042030	If what I have told you one day rings true,
316042031	
316042032	
316042033	
316042034	
316042035	
316042036	
316042037	
316042038	
316042039	
316042040	by all means, come to me again.
316050000	What's this sorcery, my apprentice?
316050001	
316050002	
316050003	
316050004	
316050005	
316050006	
316050007	
316050008	
316050009	
316050010	Ah, then you have seen Master Azur.
316050011	
316050012	
316050013	
316050014	
316050015	
316050016	
316050017	
316050018	
316050019	
316050020	Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher.
316050021	
316050022	
316050023	
316050024	
316050025	
316050026	
316050027	
316050028	
316050029	
316050030	A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you.
316050031	
316050032	
316050033	
316050034	
316050035	
316050036	
316050037	
316050038	
316050039	
316050040	You make us both proud.
316050041	
316050042	
316050043	
316050044	
316050045	
316050046	
316050047	
316050048	
316050049	
316050050	We can speak more later, my apprentice.
316060000	If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
316060001	
316060002	
316060003	
316060004	
316060005	
316060006	
316060007	
316060008	
316060009	
316060010	It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
316060011	
316060012	
316060013	
316060014	
316060015	
316060016	
316060017	
316060018	
316060019	
316060020	The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care.
316060021	
316060022	
316060023	
316060024	
316060025	
316060026	
316060027	
316060028	
316060029	
316060030	I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos.
316060031	
316060032	
316060033	
316060034	
316060035	
316060036	
316060037	
316060038	
316060039	
316060040	No matter what we give in return.
316060041	
316060042	
316060043	
316060044	
316060045	
316060046	
316060047	
316060048	
316060049	
316060050	My apprentice. I presume nothing.
316060051	
316060052	
316060053	
316060054	
316060055	
316060056	
316060057	
316060058	
316060059	
316060060	Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path.
316060061	
316060062	
316060063	
316060064	
316060065	
316060066	
316060067	
316060068	
316060069	
316060070	But hear me out, my apprentice.
316060071	
316060072	
316060073	
316060074	
316060075	
316060076	
316060077	
316060078	
316060079	
316060080	I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
316060081	
316060082	
316060083	
316060084	
316060085	
316060086	
316060087	
316060088	
316060089	
316060090	Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?
316061000	Splendid. I thank you.
316061001	
316061002	
316061003	
316061004	
316061005	
316061006	
316061007	
316061008	
316061009	
316061010	This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.
316061011	
316061012	
316061013	
316061014	
316061015	
316061016	
316061017	
316061018	
316061019	
316061020	You must have a fabulous teacher.
316062000	Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with.
316062001	
316062002	
316062003	
316062004	
316062005	
316062006	
316062007	
316062008	
316062009	
316062010	And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well.
316062011	
316062012	
316062013	
316062014	
316062015	
316062016	
316062017	
316062018	
316062019	
316062020	Don't give it another thought, my apprentice.
316063000	Really? My apprentice.
316063001	
316063002	
316063003	
316063004	
316063005	
316063006	
316063007	
316063008	
316063009	
316063010	You must have given this quite some thought.
316063011	
316063012	
316063013	
316063014	
316063015	
316063016	
316063017	
316063018	
316063019	
316063020	Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me.
316063021	
316063022	
316063023	
316063024	
316063025	
316063026	
316063027	
316063028	
316063029	
316063030	It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.
316064000	There you are, my apprentice.
316064001	
316064002	
316064003	
316064004	
316064005	
316064006	
316064007	
316064008	
316064009	
316064010	Shall we commence the lesson?
316065000	You wish to resume the lesson?
316065001	
316065002	
316065003	
316065004	
316065005	
316065006	
316065007	
316065008	
316065009	
316065010	Indeed, that would be the wiser option.
316070000	I need your help, my apprentice.
316070001	
316070002	
316070003	
316070004	
316070005	
316070006	
316070007	
316070008	
316070009	
316070010	Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer.
316070011	
316070012	
316070013	
316070014	
316070015	
316070016	
316070017	
316070018	
316070019	
316070020	And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere.
316070021	
316070022	
316070023	
316070024	
316070025	
316070026	
316070027	
316070028	
316070029	
316070030	My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat?
316070031	
316070032	
316070033	
316070034	
316070035	
316070036	
316070037	
316070038	
316070039	
316070040	With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.
316071000	I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
316071001	
316071002	
316071003	
316071004	
316071005	
316071006	
316071007	
316071008	
316071009	
316071010	He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...
316072000	After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home.
316072001	
316072002	
316072003	
316072004	
316072005	
316072006	
316072007	
316072008	
316072009	
316072010	A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds.
316072011	
316072012	
316072013	
316072014	
316072015	
316072016	
316072017	
316072018	
316072019	
316072020	Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer.
316072021	
316072022	
316072023	
316072024	
316072025	
316072026	
316072027	
316072028	
316072029	
316072030	It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby...
316080000	Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...
316080001	
316080002	
316080003	
316080004	
316080005	
316080006	
316080007	
316080008	
316080009	
316080010	You have my gratitude. This is all your work.
316080011	
316080012	
316080013	
316080014	
316080015	
316080016	
316080017	
316080018	
316080019	
316080020	I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit.
316080021	
316080022	
316080023	
316080024	
316080025	
316080026	
316080027	
316080028	
316080029	
316080030	This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.
316080031	
316080032	
316080033	
316080034	
316080035	
316080036	
316080037	
316080038	
316080039	
316080040	This brings us a full step closer.
316080041	
316080042	
316080043	
316080044	
316080045	
316080046	
316080047	
316080048	
316080049	
316080050	The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the Academy.
316080051	
316080052	
316080053	
316080054	
316080055	
316080056	
316080057	
316080058	
316080059	
316080060	If only I could undo these wretched shackles...
316081000	This brings us a full step closer.
316081001	
316081002	
316081003	
316081004	
316081005	
316081006	
316081007	
316081008	
316081009	
316081010	The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy.
316081011	
316081012	
316081013	
316081014	
316081015	
316081016	
316081017	
316081018	
316081019	
316081020	If only I could undo these wretched shackles...
316090000	My apprentice. Give me a moment later.
316090001	
316090002	
316090003	
316090004	
316090005	
316090006	
316090007	
316090008	
316090009	
316090010	I have a favour to ask.
316090011	
316090012	
316090013	
316090014	
316090015	
316090016	
316090017	
316090018	
316090019	
316090020	The form you see before you is merely a projection.
316090021	
316090022	
316090023	
316090024	
316090025	
316090026	
316090027	
316090028	
316090029	
316090030	My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved.
316090031	
316090032	
316090033	
316090034	
316090035	
316090036	
316090037	
316090038	
316090039	
316090040	My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,
316090041	
316090042	
316090043	
316090044	
316090045	
316090046	
316090047	
316090048	
316090049	
316090050	imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.
316090051	
316090052	
316090053	
316090054	
316090055	
316090056	
316090057	
316090058	
316090059	
316090060	Can you make the journey to my body?
316090061	
316090062	
316090063	
316090064	
316090065	
316090066	
316090067	
316090068	
316090069	
316090070	I have something that I can only trust with you.
316092000	My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,
316092001	
316092002	
316092003	
316092004	
316092005	
316092006	
316092007	
316092008

316110010	Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again.

316110020	And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone.

316110030	Better still, I've shed those awful shackles.

316110037	
316110038	
316110039	
316110040	Finally, I can return to the academy.

316110044	
316110045	
316110046	
316110047	
316110048	
316110049	
316110050	To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.

316110054	
316110055	
316110056	
316110057	
316110058	
316110059	
316110060	My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.
316111000	Finally, I can return to the academy.
316111001	
316111002	
316111003	
316111004	
316111005	
316111006	
316111007	
316111008	
316111009	
316111010	To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.
316112000	My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson?
316112001	
316112002	
316112003	
316112004	
316112005	
316112006	
316112007	
316112008	
316112009	
316112010	As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard.
316113000	You wish to resume the lesson?
316113001	
316113002	
316113003	
316113004	
316113005	
316113006	
316113007	
316113008	
316113009	
316113010	Have I not been strict enough, I wonder?
316120000	Ahh, my apprentice.
316120001	
316120002	
316120003	
316120004	
316120005	
316120006	
316120007	
316120008	
316120009	
316120010	You've saved my skin once again.
316120011	
316120012	
316120013	
316120014	
316120015	
316120016	
316120017	
316120018	
316120019	
316120020	Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.
316120021	
316120022	
316120023	
316120024	
316120025	
316120026	
316120027	
316120028	
316120029	
316120030	With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.
316120031	
316120032	
316120033	
316120034	
316120035	
316120036	
316120037	
316120038	
316120039	
316120040	So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.
316120041	
316120042	
316120043	
316120044	
316120045	
316120046	
316120047	
316120048	
316120049	
316120050	My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?
316120051	
316120052	
316120053	
316120054	
316120055	
316120056	
316120057	
316120058	
316120059	
316120060	Oh, I know it's not possible.
316120061	
316120062	
316120063	
316120064	
316120065	
316120066	
316120067	
316120068	
316120069	
316120070	You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.
316120071	
316120072	
316120073	
316120074	
316120075	
316120076	
316120077	
316120078	
316120079	
316120080	But do think of me.
316120081	
316120082	
316120083	
316120084	
316120085	
316120086	
316120087	
316120088	
316120089	
316120090	Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.
316120091	
316120092	
316120093	
316120094	
316120095	
316120096	
316120097	
316120098	
316120099	
316120100	You will always be my darling pupil.
316120101	
316120102	
316120103	
316120104	
316120105	
316120106	
316120107	
316120108	
316120109	
316120110	Rest assured that I...
316120111	
316120112	
316120113	
316120114	
316120115	
316120116	
316120117	
316120118	
316120119	
316120120	No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.
316120121	
316120122	
316120123	
316120124	
316120125	
316120126	
316120127	
316120128	
316120129	
316120130	My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.
316121000	Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead,
316121001	
316121002	
316121003	
316121004	
316121005	
316121006	
316121007	
316121008	
316121009	
316121010	but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.
316122000	Do you recall what once I told you?
316122001	
316122002	
316122003	
316122004	
316122005	
316122006	
316122007	
316122008	
316122009	
316122010	That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.
316122011	
316122012	
316122013	
316122014	
316122015	
316122016	
316122017	
316122018	
316122019	
316122020	When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.
316122021	
316122022	
316122023	
316122024	
316122025	
316122026	
316122027	
316122028	
316122029	
316122030	Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.
316122031	
316122032	
316122033	
316122034	
316122035	
316122036	
316122037	
316122038	
316122039	
316122040	Next time, I will be your student.
316123000	Oh, one last thing.
316123001	
316123002	
316123003	
316123004	
316123005	
316123006	
316123007	
316123008	
316123009	
316123010	If you fail to claim your throne,
316123011	
316123012	
316123013	
316123014	
316123015	
316123016	
316123017	
316123018	
316123019	
316123020	you can always pay me a visit.
316123021	
316123022	
316123023	
316123024	
316123025	
316123026	
316123027	
316123028	
316123029	
316123030	Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.
316123031	
316123032	
316123033	
316123034	
316123035	
316123036	
316123037	
316123038	
316123039	
316123040	 
316125000	What is it? My apprentice.
316126000	Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice.
316126001	
316126002	
316126003	
316126004	
316126005	
316126006	
316126007	
316126008	
316126009	
316126010	Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education.
316127000	It warms my heart. That you still think of me.
316127001	
316127002	
316127003	
316127004	
316127005	
316127006	
316127007	
316127008	
316127009	
316127010	Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat.
316127011	
316127012	
316127013	
316127014	
316127015	
316127016	
316127017	
316127018	
316127019	
316127020	His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current...
316128000	Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...
316128001	
316128002	
316128003	
316128004	
316128005	
316128006	
316128007	
316128008	
316128009	
316128010	Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home.
316128011	
316128012	
316128013	
316128014	
316128015	
316128016	
316128017	
316128018	
316128019	
316128020	And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current.
316128021	
316128022	
316128023	
316128024	
316128025	
316128026	
316128027	
316128028	
316128029	
316128030	So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again.
316128031	
316128032	
316128033	
316128034	
316128035	
316128036	
316128037	
316128038	
316128039	
316128040	I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this.
316128041	
316128042	
316128043	
316128044	
316128045	
316128046	
316128047	
316128048	
316128049	
316128050	What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit.
316128051	
316128052	
316128053	
316128054	
316128055	
316128056	
316128057	
316128058	
316128059	
316128060	This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.
316129000	You wish to resume the lesson?
316129001	
316129002	
316129003	
316129004	
316129005	
316129006	
316129007	
316129008	
316129009	
316129010	Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not?
316129030	With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current.
316129031	
316129032	
316129033	
316129034	
316129035	
316129036	
316129037	
316129038	
316129039	
316129040	So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again.
316130000	Jerren, bringer of my death.
316130001	
316130002	
316130003	
316130004	
316130005	
316130006	
316130007	
316130008	
316130009	
316130010	You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.
316130011	
316130012	
316130013	
316130014	
316130015	
316130016	
316130017	
316130018	
316130019	
316130020	But I am afraid your work is done.
316130021	
316130022	
316130023	
316130024	
316130025	
316130026	
316130027	
316130028	
316130029	
316130030	Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.
316140000	U...urgh
316140001	
316140002	
316140003	
316140004	
316140005	
316140006	
316140007	
316140008	
316140009	
316140010	M-my...apprentice...
316140011	
316140012	
316140013	
316140014	
316140015	
316140016	
316140017	
316140018	
316140019	
316140020	I-I'm...
316141000	My...apprentice...
316150000	Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days.
316150001	
316150002	
316150003	
316150004	
316150005	
316150006	
316150007	
316150008	
316150009	
316150010	Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar.
316150011	
316150012	
316150013	
316150014	
316150015	
316150016	
316150017	
316150018	
316150019	
316150020	I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons.
316150021	
316150022	
316150023	
316150024	
316150025	
316150026	
316150027	
316150028	
316150029	
316150030	Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.
316800000	What's the meaning of this?
316801000	How unfortunate.
316801001	
316801002	
316801003	
316801004	
316801005	
316801006	
316801007	
316801008	
316801009	
316801010	That we should part ways in this manner...
316802000	Ngh!
316803000	Why, you. Are you mad?
316804000	My death would only be temporary.
316804001	
316804002	
316804003	
316804004	
316804005	
316804006	
316804007	
316804008	
316804009	
316804010	Your savagery achieves nothing.
316805000	Agh!
316806000	Why, you. Are you mad?
316806001	
316806002	
316806003	
316806004	
316806005	
316806006	
316806007	
316806008	
316806009	
316806010	Another moment of this, and no amount of grovelling will spare you.
316807000	You sadden me, my apprentice.
316808000	Ahh, how can this be...
316808001	
316808002	
316808003	
316808004	
316808005	
316808006	
316808007	
316808008	
316808009	
316808010	...every fallen child... must shine again...
316809000	For a time, I believed us kindred spirits.
316809001	
316809002	
316809003	
316809004	
316809005	
316809006	
316809007	
316809008	
316809009	
316809010	My apprentice...
316900000	 
316900001	
316900002	
316900003	
316900004

316900017	
316900018	
316900019	
316900020	 
318001000	If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger.
318001001	
318001002	
318001003	
318001004	
318001005	
318001006	
318001007	
318001008	
318001009	
318001010	The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.
318010000	Just joining the fray, Tarnished?
318010001	
318010002	
318010003	
318010004	
318010005	
318010006	
318010007	
318010008	
318010009	
318010010	Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.
318010011	
318010012	
318010013	
318010014	
318010015	
318010016	
318010017	
318010018	
318010019	
318010020	I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.
318010021	
318010022	
318010023	
318010024	
318010025	
318010026	
318010027	
318010028	
318010029	
318010030	Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
318010031	
318010032	
318010033	
318010034	
318010035	
318010036	
318010037	
318010038	
318010039	
318010040	If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
318010041	
318010042	
318010043	
318010044	
318010045	
318010046	
318010047	
318010048	
318010049	
318010050	Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
318010051	
318010052	
318010053	
318010054	
318010055	
318010056	
318010057	
318010058	
318010059	
318010060	Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
318010900	Well, you fought Nerijus and made good your escape. Fortune favours you, it seems.
318011000	Oh, one other thing...
318011001	
318011002	
318011003	
318011004	
318011005	
318011006	
318011007	
318011008	
318011009	
318011010	There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers.
318011011	
318011012	
318011013	
318011014	
318011015	
318011016	
318011017	
318011018	
318011019	
318011020	If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring.
318011021	
318011022	
318011023	
318011024	
318011025	
318011026	
318011027	
318011028	
318011029	
318011030	If fortune takes your side, a hunter will come to your aid.
318013000	Just joining the fray, Tarnished?
318013001	
318013002	
318013003

318013013	
318013014	
318013015	
318013016	
318013017	
318013018	
318013019	
318013020	Have you ever faced a Bloody Finger?
318013021	
318013022	
318013023	
318013024	
318013025	
318013026	
318013027	
318013028	
318013029	
318013030	They are Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.

318013032	
318013033	
318013034	
318013035	
318013036	
318013037	
318013038	
318013039	
318013040	If you stay the path, you will face this blight, sooner or later.
318013041	
318013042	
318013043	
318013044	
318013045

318013059	
318013060	Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
318014000	If fortune remains on your side, a hunter will come to your aid.
318015000	One last word of warning.
318015001	
318015002	
318015003	
318015004	
318015005	
318015006	
318015007	
318015008	
318015009	
318015010	Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.
318016000	Be on your way.
318016001	
318016002	
318016003	
318016004	
318016005	
318016006	
318016007	
318016008	
318016009	
318016010	Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.
318020000	Well, we meet again.
318020001	
318020002	
318020003	
318020004	
318020005	
318020006	
318020007	
318020008	
318020009	
318020010	Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake.
318020011	
318020012	
318020013	
318020014	
318020015	
318020016	
318020017	
318020018	
318020019	
318020020	And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.
318020021	
318020022	
318020023	
318020024	
318020025	
318020026	
318020027	
318020028	
318020029	
318020030	So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...
318020031	
318020032	
318020033	
318020034	
318020035	
318020036	
318020037	
318020038	
318020039	
318020040	stay clear of the lake.
318021000	Hmm, I gave you fair warning.
318021001	
318021002	
318021003	
318021004	
318021005	
318021006	
318021007	
318021008	
318021009	
318021010	To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost.
318021011	
318021012	
318021013	
318021014	
318021015	
318021016	
318021017	
318021018	
318021019	
318021020	Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.
318022000	Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.
318023000	Ah, we meet again.
318023001	
318023002	
318023003	
318023004	
318023005	
318023006	
318023007	
318023008	
318023009	
318023010	To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle.
318023011	
318023012	
318023013	
318023014	
318023015	
318023016	
318023017	
318023018	
318023019	
318023020	To have fought Nerijus and escaped, fortune must smile upon you indeed.

318023027	
318023028

318023070	Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
318024000	Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.

318024004	
318024005

318024007	
318024008	
318024009	
318024010	You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling. A dragon roosts there...
318025000	You bloody halfwit.
318025001	
318025002	
318025003	
318025004	
318025005	
318025006	
318025007	
318025008	
318025009	
318025010	Picking a fight with a dragon?
318025011	
318025012	
318025013	
318025014	
318025015	
318025016	
318025017	
318025018	
318025019	
318025020	Well, I can tell you want to see it through.
318025021	
318025022	
318025023	
318025024	
318025025	
318025026	
318025027	
318025028	
318025029	
318025030	Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.
318026000	Ah, we meet again.
318026001	
318026002	
318026003	
318026004	
318026005	
318026006	
318026007	
318026008	
318026009	
318026010	I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
318026011	
318026012	
318026013	
318026014	
318026015	
318026016	
318026017	
318026018	
318026019	
318026020	Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
318026021	
318026022	
318026023	
318026024	
318026025	
318026026	
318026027	
318026028	
318026029	
318026030	If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
318026031	
318026032	
318026033	
318026034	
318026035	
318026036	
318026037	
318026038	
318026039	
318026040	Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
318026041	
318026042	
318026043	
318026044	
318026045	
318026046	
318026047	
318026048	
318026049	
318026050	Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
318027000	Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
318027001	
318027002	
318027003	
318027004	
318027005	
318027006	
318027007	
318027008	
318027009	
318027010	And quite the fool, by the look of it.
318027011	
318027012	
318027013	
318027014	
318027015	
318027016	
318027017	
318027018	
318027019	
318027020	Picking a fight with a dragon? Hah.
318027021	
318027022	
318027023	
318027024	
318027025	
318027026	
318027027	
318027028	
318027029	
318027030	Well, I can tell you want to see it through.
318027031	
318027032	
318027033	
318027034	
318027035	
318027036	
318027037	
318027038	
318027039	
318027040	Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.
318028000	I can tell you want to see it through.
318028001	
318028002	
318028003	
318028004	
318028005	
318028006	
318028007	
318028008	
318028009	
318028010	Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.
318030000	There you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time.
318030001	
318030002	
318030003	
318030004	
318030005	
318030006	
318030007	
318030008	
318030009	
318030010	Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.
318030040	Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.
318030041	
318030042	
318030043	
318030044	
318030045	
318030046	
318030047	
318030048	
318030049	
318030050	That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
318030051	
318030052	
318030053	
318030054	
318030055	
318030056	
318030057	
318030058	
318030059	
318030060	If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
318030061	
318030062	
318030063	
318030064	
318030065	
318030066	
318030067	
318030068	
318030069	
318030070	then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
318031000	You must not forget, though.
318031001	
318031002	
318031003	
318031004	
318031005	
318031006	
318031007	
318031008	
318031009	
318031010	Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity.
318031011	
318031012	
318031013	
318031014	
318031015	
318031016	
318031017	
318031018	
318031019	
318031020	Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens.
318031021	
318031022	
318031023	
318031024	
318031025	
318031026	
318031027	
318031028	
318031029	
318031030	Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment.
318031031	
318031032	
318031033	
318031034	
318031035	
318031036	
318031037	
318031038	
318031039	
318031040	The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly.
318031041	
318031042	
318031043	
318031044	
318031045	
318031046	
318031047	
318031048	
318031049	
318031050	It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.
318032000	Beautiful work, felling that dragon.
318032001	
318032002	
318032003	
318032004	
318032005	
318032006	
318032007	
318032008	
318032009	
318032010	And as such, there's something you might like to know.
318033000	...
318033001	
318033002	
318033003	
318033004	
318033005	
318033006	
318033007	
318033008	
318033009	
318033010	Wretched worms, leave me be...
318033011	
318033012	
318033013	
318033014	
318033015	
318033016	
318033017	
318033018	
318033019	
318033020	 
318034000	Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
318034001	
318034002	
318034003	
318034004	
318034005	
318034006	
318034007	
318034008	
318034009	
318034010	That was my first dragon hunt in quite a while.
318034011	
318034012	
318034013	
318034014	
318034015	
318034016	
318034017	
318034018	
318034019	
318034020	Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.
318034021

318034023	
318034024

318034040	The heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.

318034046	
318034047	
318034048	
318034049	
318034050	If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
318034051	
318034052	
318034053	
318034054	
318034055	
318034056	
318034057	
318034058	
318034059	
318034060	then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
318035000	Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
318035001	
318035002	
318035003	
318035004	
318035005	
318035006	
318035007	
318035008	
318035009	
318035010	Beautiful work, felling that dragon.
318035011	
318035012	
318035013	
318035014	
318035015	
318035016	
318035017	
318035018	
318035019	
318035020	And as such, there's something you might like to know.
318035021	
318035022	
318035023	
318035024

318035026	
318035027	
318035028	
318035029	
318035030	That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
318035031	
318035032	
318035033	
318035034

318035036	
318035037	
318035038	
318035039	
318035040	If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
318035041	
318035042	
318035043	
318035044	
318035045	
318035046	
318035047	
318035048	
318035049	
318035050	then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
318040000	Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.
318040001	
318040002	
318040003	
318040004	
318040005	
318040006	
318040007	
318040008	
318040009	
318040010	That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.
318040011	
318040012	
318040013	
318040014	
318040015	
318040016	
318040017	
318040018	
318040019	
318040020	Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it.
318041000	I may not have much time.
318041001	
318041002	
318041003	
318041004	
318041005	
318041006	
318041007	
318041008	
318041009	
318041010	I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...
318042000	Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.
318042001	
318042002	
318042003	
318042004	
318042005	
318042006	
318042007	
318042008	
318042009	
318042010	She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.
318042011	
318042012	
318042013	
318042014	
318042015	
318042016	
318042017	
318042018	
318042019	
318042020	But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.
318042021	
318042022	
318042023	
318042024	
318042025	
318042026	
318042027	
318042028	
318042029	
318042030	If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.
318042031	
318042032	
318042033	
318042034	
318042035	
318042036	
318042037	
318042038	
318042039	
318042040	There is no shame in self-preservation.
318043000	Be on your way.
318043001	
318043002	
318043003	
318043004	
318043005	
318043006	
318043007	
318043008	
318043009	
318043010	Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.
318070000	Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you.
318070001	
318070002	
318070003	
318070004	
318070005	
318070006	
318070007	
318070008	
318070009	
318070010	But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.
318070011	
318070012	
318070013	
318070014	
318070015	
318070016	
318070017	
318070018	
318070019	
318070020	I've sliced the finger off.
318070021	
318070022	
318070023	
318070024	
318070025	
318070026	
318070027	
318070028	
318070029	
318070030	Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.
318070031	
318070032	
318070033	
318070034	
318070035	
318070036	
318070037	
318070038	
318070039	
318070040	Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...
318080000	Finally, we meet.
318080001	
318080002	
318080003	
318080004	
318080005	
318080006	
318080007	
318080008	
318080009	
318080010	The Tarnished, who would be Lord.
318080011	
318080012	
318080013	
318080014	
318080015	
318080016	
318080017	
318080018	
318080019	
318080020	Oh my, why the long face?
318080021	
318080022	
318080023	
318080024	
318080025	
318080026	
318080027	
318080028	
318080029	
318080030	I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.
318080031	
318080032	
318080033	
318080034	
318080035	
318080036	
318080037	
318080038	
318080039	
318080040	Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead.
318080041	
318080042	
318080043	
318080044	
318080045	
318080046	
318080047	
318080048	
318080049	
318080050	As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri.
318080051	
318080052	
318080053	
318080054	
318080055	
318080056	
318080057	
318080058	
318080059	
318080060	I hope you can make your peace with that.
318081000	You are about to sacrifice something precious.
318081001	
318081002	
318081003	
318081004	
318081005	
318081006	
318081007	
318081008	
318081009	
318081010	The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge.
318081011	
318081012	
318081013	
318081014	
318081015	
318081016	
318081017	
318081018	
318081019	
318081020	Only so that you may be Lord.
318081021	
318081022	
318081023	
318081024	
318081025	
318081026	
318081027	
318081028	
318081029	
318081030	What a horrible thing to ponder.
318081031	
318081032	
318081033	
318081034	
318081035	
318081036	
318081037	
318081038	
318081039	
318081040	Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.
318081041	
318081042	
318081043	
318081044	
318081045	
318081046	
318081047	
318081048	
318081049	
318081050	But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?
318082000	Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor.
318082001	
318082002	
318082003	
318082004	
318082005	
318082006	
318082007	
318082008	
318082009	
318082010	Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead.
318082011	
318082012	
318082013	
318082014	
318082015	
318082016	
318082017	
318082018	
318082019	
318082020	If you are prepared to show resolve,
318082021	
318082022	
318082023	
318082024	
318082025	
318082026	
318082027	
318082028	
318082029	
318082030	and attain Lordship through righteous hardship,
318082031	
318082032	
318082033	
318082034	
318082035	
318082036	
318082037	
318082038	
318082039	
318082040	then heed the words of I, Shabriri.
318083000	Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.
318083001	
318083002	
318083003	
318083004	
318083005	
318083006	
318083007	
318083008	
318083009	
318083010	Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.
318083011	
318083012	
318083013	
318083014	
318083015	
318083016	
318083017	
318083018	
318083019	
318083020	Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.
318083021	
318083022	
318083023	
318083024	
318083025	
318083026	
318083027	
318083028	
318083029	
318083030	If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling,
318083031	
318083032	
318083033	
318083034	
318083035	
318083036	
318083037	
318083038	
318083039	
318083040	and the girl can be spared.
318083041	
318083042	
318083043	
318083044	
318083045	
318083046	
318083047	
318083048	
318083049	
318083050	...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.
318083051	
318083052	
318083053	
318083054	
318083055	
318083056	
318083057	
318083058	
318083059	
318083060	The path of the Lord of Chaos.
318083061	
318083062	
318083063	
318083064	
318083065	
318083066	
318083067	
318083068	
318083069	
318083070	Burn the Erdtree to the ground,
318083071	
318083072	
318083073	
318083074	
318083075	
318083076	
318083077	
318083078	
318083079	
318083080	and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
318083081	
318083082	
318083083	
318083084	
318083085

318083087	
318083088	
318083089	
318083090	Ahh, may chaos take the world!

318083094	
318083095

318083097	
318083098	
318083099	
318083100	May chaos take the world!
318084000	Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.

318084016	
318084017	
318084018	
318084019	
318084020	Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.
318085000	Burn the Erdtree to the ground,
318085001	
318085002	
318085003	
318085004	
318085005	
318085006	
318085007	
318085008

318085028	
318085029	
318085030	May chaos take the world!
318800000	Ugh.
318801000	That will be quite enough.
318801001	
318801002	
318801003	
318801004	
318801005	
318801006	
318801007	
318801008	
318801009	
318801010	What do you stand to gain by challenging me?
318802000	Too late for you, eh?
318802001	
318802002	
318802003	
318802004	
318802005	
318802006	
318802007	
318802008	
318802009	
318802010	Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood...
318802011	
318802012	
318802013	
318802014	
318802015	
318802016	
318802017	
318802018	
318802019	
318802020	it's better that I finish you here.
318803000	I had no choice.
318803001	
318803002	
318803003	
318803004	
318803005	
318803006	
318803007	
318803008	
318803009	
318803010	Your death could have been much worse.
318804000	What a wretched fate.
318804001	
318804002	
318804003	
318804004	
318804005	
318804006	
318804007	
318804008	
318804009	
318804010	Why did you turn foul...
318805000	I must not die...
318805001	
318805002	
318805003	
318805004	
318805005	
318805006	
318805007	
318805008	
318805009	
318805010	until she is eradicated...
318805011	
318805012	
318805013	
318805014	
318805015	
318805016	
318805017	
318805018	
318805019	
318805020	 
318820000	What's this?
318821000	Well, this is peculiar.
318821001	
318821002	
318821003	
318821004	
318821005	
318821006	
318821007	
318821008	
318821009	
318821010	Is this how you express contempt?
318822000	This, I did not expect.
318822001	
318822002	
318822003	
318822004	
318822005	
318822006	
318822007	
318822008	
318822009	
318822010	But if you do not care for Lordship,
318822011	
318822012	
318822013	
318822014	
318822015	
318822016	
318822017	
318822018	
318822019	
318822020	I'm afraid you are of no use.
318823000	How very unfortunate.
318823001	
318823002	
318823003	
318823004	
318823005	
318823006	
318823007	
318823008	
318823009	
318823010	I did not take you for a fraud.
318824000	Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die.
318824001	
318824002	
318824003	
318824004	
318824005	
318824006	
318824007	
318824008	
318824009	
318824010	Until we meet again, in another place or time.
318824011	
318824012	
318824013	
318824014	
318824015	
318824016	
318824017	
318824018	
318824019	
318824020	Ahh, may chaos take the world!

318910018	
318910019	
318910020	 
319001000	There's no mistake, is there?
319001001	
319001002	
319001003	
319001004	
319001005	
319001006	
319001007	
319001008	
319001009	
319001010	Death has left its mark once again.
319001011	
319001012	
319001013	
319001014	
319001015	
319001016	
319001017	
319001018	
319001019	
319001020	I'm sorry, I cannot give you your proper rites...
319001021	
319001022	
319001023	
319001024	
319001025	
319001026	
319001027	
319001028	
319001029	
319001030	But at least you did not join Those Who Live in Death.
319001031	
319001032	
319001033	
319001034	
319001035	
319001036	
319001037	
319001038	
319001039	
319001040	Your soul will return to the Erdtree, in time.
319001041	
319001042	
319001043	
319001044	
319001045	
319001046	
319001047	
319001048	
319001049	
319001050	Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.
319002000	Ah, a Tarnished, are you?
319002001	
319002002	
319002003	
319002004	
319002005	
319002006	
319002007	
319002008	
319002009	
319002010	I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.
319002011	
319002012	
319002013	
319002014	
319002015	
319002016	
319002017	
319002018	
319002019	
319002020	Heed my warning.
319002021	
319002022	
319002023	
319002024	
319002025	
319002026	
319002027	
319002028	
319002029	
319002030	The village here has been touched by Death.
319002031	
319002032	
319002033	
319002034	
319002035	
319002036	
319002037	
319002038	
319002039	
319002040	And worse yet, it is home to a mariner.
319002041	
319002042	
319002043	
319002044	
319002045	
319002046	
319002047	
319002048	
319002049	
319002050	If you value your life, then go no further.
319003000	The village here has been touched by Death.
319003001	
319003002	
319003003	
319003004	
319003005	
319003006	
319003007	
319003008	
319003009	
319003010	Turn back, while you still can.
319010000	Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?
319010001	
319010002	
319010003	
319010004	
319010005	
319010006	
319010007	
319010008	
319010009	
319010010	But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
319010011	
319010012	
319010013	
319010014	
319010015	
319010016	
319010017	
319010018	
319010019	
319010020	...
319010021	
319010022	
319010023	
319010024	
319010025	
319010026	
319010027	
319010028	
319010029	
319010030	How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
319010031	
319010032	
319010033	
319010034	
319010035	
319010036	
319010037	
319010038	
319010039	
319010040	If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
319010041	
319010042

319010048	
319010049	
319010050	then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.

319010053	
319010054	
319010055	
319010056	
319010057	
319010058	
319010059	
319010060	I have a matter of my own to attend to.
319010061

319010065	
319010066	
319010067	
319010068	
319010069	
319010070	And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
319010071	
319010072	
319010073	
319010074	
319010075

319010077	
319010078	
319010079	
319010080	What say you?
319011000	Very well. Show me your map.
319011001	
319011002	
319011003	
319011004

319011016	
319011017	
319011018	
319011019	
319011020	I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.
319011021	
319011022	
319011023	
319011024	
319011025

319011027	
319011028	
319011029	
319011030	It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
319012000	I have a matter of my own to attend to.

319012006	
319012007	
319012008	
319012009	
319012010	I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village.
319012011	
319012012	
319012013	
319012014	
319012015	
319012016	
319012017	
319012018	
319012019	
319012020	An ill-omened symbol that should not be.
319012021	
319012022	
319012023	
319012024	
319012025	
319012026	
319012027	
319012028	
319012029	
319012030	Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.
319012031	
319012032	
319012033	
319012034	
319012035	
319012036	
319012037	
319012038	
319012039	
319012040	And must be eradicated.
319013000	What is it? Still milling about?
319013001	
319013002	
319013003	
319013004	
319013005	
319013006	
319013007	
319013008	
319013009	
319013010	The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
319013011	
319013012	
319013013	
319013014	
319013015	
319013016	
319013017	
319013018	
319013019	
319013020	It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
319014000	Well, all right, then.

319014006	
319014007	
319014008	
319014009	
319014010	No sense in forcing you.
319015000	What now? Had a change of heart?
319016000	Ah, a Tarnished, are you?
319016001	
319016002

319016030	I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.

319016037	
319016038	
319016039	
319016040	How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
319016041	
319016042	
319016043	
319016044	
319016045	
319016046	
319016047	
319016048	
319016049	
319016050	If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
319016051	
319016052	
319016053	
319016054

319016076	
319016077	
319016078	
319016079	
319016080	And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
319020000	Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look!
319020001	
319020002	
319020003	
319020004	
319020005	
319020006	
319020007	
319020008	
319020009	
319020010	See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood!

319020012	
319020013	
319020014

319020017	
319020018	
319020019	
319020020	This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone!

319020030	This is a proper death, O Prince!

319020067	
319020068	
319020069	
319020070	This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D!
319021000	Ah. Hello.
319021001	
319021002

319021030	Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.
319022000	Darian, now I have no regrets.

319120042	
319120043	
319120044	
319120045	
319120046	
319120047	
319120048	
319120049	
319120050	Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain.

319130006	
319130007	
319130008	
319130009	
319130010	Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?
319130011	
319130012	
319130013	
319130014	
319130015

319130019	
319130020	But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
319130021	
319130022	
319130023	
319130024	
319130025	
319130026	
319130027	
319130028	
319130029	
319130030	With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
319130031	
319130032	
319130033	
319130034	
319130035	
319130036	
319130037	
319130038	
319130039	
319130040	...
319130041	
319130042	
319130043	
319130044	
319130045	
319130046	
319130047	
319130048	
319130049	
319130050	How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
319130051	
319130052	
319130053	
319130054	
319130055	
319130056	
319130057	
319130058	
319130059	
319130060	If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
319130061	
319130062	
319130063	
319130064	
319130065	
319130066	
319130067	
319130068	
319130069	
319130070	then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
319130071	
319130072	
319130073	
319130074	
319130075	
319130076	
319130077	
319130078	
319130079	
319130080	I have a matter of my own to attend to.
319130081	
319130082	
319130083	
319130084	
319130085	
319130086	
319130087	
319130088	
319130089	
319130090	And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
319130091	
319130092	
319130093	
319130094	
319130095	
319130096	
319130097	
319130098	
319130099	
319130100	What say you?
319131000	Very well. Show me your map.
319131001	
319131002	
319131003	
319131004	
319131005	
319131006	
319131007	
319131008	
319131009	
319131010	...
319131011	
319131012	
319131013	
319131014	
319131015	
319131016	
319131017	
319131018	
319131019	
319131020	I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.
319131021	
319131022	
319131023	
319131024	
319131025	
319131026	
319131027	
319131028	
319131029	
319131030	It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
319132000	I have a matter of my own to attend to.
319132001	
319132002	
319132003	
319132004	
319132005	
319132006	
319132007	
319132008	
319132009	
319132010	I've spotted the mark of the centipede.
319132011	
319132012	
319132013	
319132014	
319132015	
319132016	
319132017	
319132018	
319132019	
319132020	An ill-omened symbol that should not be.
319132021	
319132022	
319132023	
319132024	
319132025	
319132026	
319132027	
319132028	
319132029	
319132030	Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.
319132031	
319132032	
319132033	
319132034	
319132035	
319132036	
319132037	
319132038	
319132039	
319132040	And must be eradicated.
319133000	What is it? Still milling about?
319133001	
319133002	
319133003	
319133004	
319133005	
319133006	
319133007	
319133008	
319133009	
319133010	The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
319133011	
319133012	
319133013	
319133014	
319133015	
319133016	
319133017	
319133018	
319133019	
319133020	It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
319134000	Well, all right, then.
319134001	
319134002	
319134003	
319134004	
319134005	
319134006	
319134007	
319134008	
319134009	
319134010	No sense in forcing you.
319135000	What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you?
319140000	You've met Gurranq, I take it?
319140001	
319140002	
319140003	
319140004	
319140005	
319140006	
319140007	
319140008	
319140009	
319140010	Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms.
319140011	
319140012	
319140013	
319140014	
319140015	
319140016	
319140017	
319140018	
319140019	
319140020	I think you've earned this.
319140021	
319140022	
319140023	
319140024	
319140025	
319140026	
319140027	
319140028	
319140029	
319140030	The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death.
319141000	Did you need something else?
319142000	Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?
319143000	Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it.
319143001	
319143002	
319143003	
319143004	
319143005	
319143006	
319143007	
319143008	
319143009	
319143010	I thank you, as your brother-in-arms.
319143011	
319143012	
319143013	
319143014	
319143015	
319143016	
319143017	
319143018	
319143019	
319143020	So what can I do for you?
319144000	Ah, hello again.
319144001	
319144002	
319144003	
319144004	
319144005	
319144006	
319144007	
319144008	
319144009	
319144010	You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you?
319144011	
319144012	
319144013	
319144014	
319144015	
319144016	
319144017	
319144018	
319144019	
319144020	Well, no rush. You do as you please.
319144021	
319144022	
319144023	
319144024	
319144025	
319144026	
319144027	
319144028	
319144029	
319144030	Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh.
319145000	Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right.
319145001	
319145002	
319145003	
319145004	
319145005	
319145006	
319145007	
319145008	
319145009	
319145010	Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot...
319145011	
319145012	
319145013	
319145014	
319145015	
319145016	
319145017	
319145018	
319145019	
319145020	Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve.
319150000	I serve the Golden Order.
319150001	
319150002	
319150003	
319150004	
319150005	
319150006	
319150007	
319150008	
319150009	
319150010	That I might put this crooked land to rights.
319150011	
319150012	
319150013	
319150014	
319150015	
319150016	
319150017	
319150018	
319150019	
319150020	Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring.
319150021	
319150022	
319150023	
319150024	
319150025	
319150026	
319150027	
319150028	
319150029	
319150030	Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.
319150031	
319150032	
319150033	
319150034	
319150035	
319150036	
319150037	
319150038	
319150039	
319150040	Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth.
319150041	
319150042	
319150043	
319150044	
319150045	
319150046	
319150047	
319150048	
319150049	
319150050	And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last.
319151000	Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier?
319151001	
319151002	
319151003	
319151004	
319151005	
319151006	
319151007	
319151008	
319151009	
319151010	You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony?
319151011	
319151012	
319151013	
319151014	
319151015	
319151016	
319151017	
319151018	
319151019	
319151020	He was a formidable spellblade, in times past.
319151021	
319151022	
319151023	
319151024	
319151025	
319151026	
319151027	
319151028	
319151029	
319151030	Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind.
319151031	
319151032	
319151033	
319151034	
319151035	
319151036	
319151037	
319151038	
319151039	
319151040	No more though.
319151041	
319151042	
319151043	
319151044	
319151045	
319151046	
319151047	
319151048	
319151049	
319151050	You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling...
319151051	
319151052	
319151053	
319151054	
319151055	
319151056	
319151057	
319151058	
319151059	
319151060	Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch.
319151061	
319151062	
319151063	
319151064	
319151065	
319151066	
319151067	
319151068	
319151069	
319151070	Take well the lesson, friend.
319151071	
319151072	
319151073	
319151074	
319151075	
319151076	
319151077	
319151078	
319151079	
319151080	That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death.
319151081	
319151082	
319151083	
319151084	
319151085	
319151086	
319151087	
319151088	
319151089	
319151090	When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them.
319152000	Well, what have we here?
319152001	
319152002	
319152003	
319152004	
319152005	
319152006	
319152007	
319152008	
319152009	
319152010	How did you get your hands on that dagger?
319152011	
319152012	
319152013	
319152014	
319152015	
319152016	
319152017	
319152018	
319152019	
319152020	...
319152021	
319152022	
319152023	
319152024	
319152025	
319152026	
319152027	
319152028	
319152029	
319152030	Well. That hardly matters.
319152031	
319152032	
319152033	
319152034	
319152035	
319152036	
319152037	
319152038	
319152039	
319152040	I know very well whose dagger it is.
319152041	
319152042	
319152043	
319152044	
319152045	
319152046	
319152047	
319152048	
319152049	
319152050	Why don't I return it to them for you?
319152051	
319152052	
319152053	
319152054	
319152055	
319152056	
319152057	
319152058	
319152059	
319152060	Good work, bringing this to me.
319800000	<wince>
319800001	
319800002	
319800003	
319800004	
319800005	
319800006	
319800007	
319800008	
319800009	
319800010	Don't you dare.
319800011	
319800012	
319800013	
319800014	
319800015	
319800016	
319800017	
319800018	
319800019	
319800020	Unless you want to die like a dog?
319801000	Very well.
319801001	
319801002	
319801003	
319801004	
319801005	
319801006	
319801007	
319801008	
319801009	
319801010	Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.
319802000	I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished.
319803000	How could this...happen...?
319803001	
319803002	
319803003	
319803004	
319803005	
319803006	
319803007	
319803008	
319803009	
319803010	Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin...
319810000	Oof!
319810001	
319810002	
319810003	
319810004	
319810005	
319810006	
319810007	
319810008	
319810009	
319810010	What's the meaning of this?
319810011	
319810012	
319810013	
319810014	
319810015	
319810016	
319810017	
319810018	
319810019	
319810020	Has she bewitched you?
319811000	Very well.
319811001	
319811002	
319811003	
319811004	
319811005	
319811006	
319811007	
319811008	
319811009	
319811010	Then you are a blight.
319811011	
319811012	
319811013	
319811014	
319811015	
319811016	
319811017	
319811018	
319811019	
319811020	A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother!
319811021	
319811022	
319811023	
319811024	
319811025	
319811026	
319811027	
319811028	
319811029	
319811030	Die! Die! Die!
319811031	
319811032	
319811033	
319811034	
319811035	
319811036	
319811037	
319811038	
319811039	
319811040	I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains.
319811041	
319811042	
319811043	
319811044	
319811045	
319811046	
319811047	
319811048	
319811049	
319811050	A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished!
319812000	You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged!
319813000	How could this...
319813001	
319813002	
319813003	
319813004	
319813005	
319813006	
319813007	
319813008	
319813009	
319813010	Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian...
319900000	 
319900001	
319900002	
319900003	
319900004	
319900005	
319900006	
319900007	
319900008	
319900009	
319900010	 
319900011	
319900012	
319900013	
319900014	
319900015	
319900016	
319900017	
319900018	
319900019	
319900020	 
319910000	 
319910001	
319910002	
319910003	
319910004	
319910005	
319910006	
319910007	
319910008	
319910009	
319910010	 
319910011	
319910012	
319910013	
319910014	
319910015	
319910016	
319910017	
319910018	
319910019	
319910020	 
320001000	Everyone's...been grafted.
320001001	
320001002	
320001003	
320001004	
320001005	
320001006	
320001007	
320001008	
320001009	
320001010	Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.
320001011	
320001012	
320001013	
320001014	
320001015	
320001016	
320001017	
320001018	
320001019	
320001020	Heh...
320001021	
320001022	
320001023	
320001024	
320001025	
320001026	
320001027	
320001028	
320001029	
320001030	Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken.\nTaken and stuck to the spider.
320001031	
320001032	
320001033	
320001034	
320001035	
320001036	
320001037	
320001038	
320001039	
320001040	Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.
320001041	
320001042	
320001043	
320001044	
320001045	
320001046	
320001047	
320001048	
320001049	
320001050	It's quite the lark, when you think about it.
320002000	You're all on your own, are you?
320002001	
320002002	
320002003	
320002004	
320002005	
320002006	
320002007	
320002008	
320002009	
320002010	And heading to Stormveil Castle?
320002011	
320002012	
320002013	
320002014	
320002015	
320002016	
320002017	
320002018	
320002019	
320002020	Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?
320002021	
320002022	
320002023	
320002024	
320002025	
320002026	
320002027	
320002028	
320002029	
320002030	Well, that makes us two peas in a pod.
320002031	
320002032	
320002033	
320002034	
320002035	
320002036	
320002037	
320002038	
320002039	
320002040	But I don't have your courage.
320002041	
320002042	
320002043	
320002044	
320002045	
320002046	
320002047	
320002048	
320002049	
320002050	It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.
320002051	
320002052	
320002053	
320002054	
320002055	
320002056	
320002057	
320002058	
320002059	
320002060	I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.
320002061	
320002062	
320002063	
320002064	
320002065	
320002066	
320002067	
320002068	
320002069	
320002070	I'm nothing but a craven.
320003000	Oh, I know.
320003001	
320003002	
320003003	
320003004	
320003005	
320003006	
320003007	
320003008	
320003009	
320003010	Can you take this little one along with you?
320003011	
320003012	
320003013	
320003014	
320003015	
320003016	
320003017	
320003018	
320003019	
320003020	Can you take these little ones along with you?
320003021	
320003022	
320003023	
320003024	
320003025	
320003026	
320003027	
320003028	
320003029	
320003030	The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself…
320003031	
320003032	
320003033	
320003034	
320003035	
320003036	
320003037	
320003038	
320003039	
320003040	And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
320003041	
320003042	
320003043	
320003044	
320003045	
320003046	
320003047	
320003048	
320003049	
320003050	It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.
320003051	
320003052	
320003053	
320003054	
320003055	
320003056	
320003057	
320003058	
320003059	
320003060	They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.
320003900	The poor things deserve someone braver than myself…
320005000	It was a pleasure to see you.
320005001	
320005002	
320005003	
320005004	
320005005	
320005006	
320005007	
320005008	
320005009	
320005010	Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?
320005011	
320005012	
320005013	
320005014	
320005015	
320005016	
320005017	
320005018	
320005019	
320005020	Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.
320005021	
320005022	
320005023	
320005024	
320005025	
320005026	
320005027	
320005028	
320005029	
320005030	I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know.
320005031	
320005032	
320005033	
320005034	
320005035	
320005036	
320005037	
320005038	
320005039	
320005040	Heh heh...
320013000	What's this?
320013001	
320013002	
320013003	
320013004	
320013005	
320013006	
320013007	
320013008	
320013009	
320013010	A keepsake? From my men?
320013011	
320013012	
320013013	
320013014	
320013015	
320013016	
320013017	
320013018	
320013019	
320013020	Oh, goodness me…
320013021	
320013022	
320013023	
320013024	
320013025	
320013026	
320013027	
320013028	
320013029	
320013030	I can't…
320013031	
320013032	
320013033	
320013034	
320013035	
320013036	
320013037	
320013038	
320013039	
320013040	...
320014000	A pleasure to see you.
320014001	
320014002	
320014003	
320014004	
320014005	
320014006	
320014007	
320014008	
320014009	
320014010	Did you give the little chrysalids the message?
320014011	
320014012	
320014013	
320014014	
320014015	
320014016	
320014017	
320014018	
320014019	
320014020	That I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.
320020000	They all...believed in me.
320020001	
320020002	
320020003	
320020004	
320020005	
320020006	
320020007	
320020008	
320020009	
320020010	They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...
320020011	
320020012	
320020013	
320020014	
320020015	
320020016	
320020017	
320020018	
320020019	
320020020	I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.
320020021	
320020022	
320020023	
320020024	
320020025	
320020026	
320020027	
320020028	
320020029	
320020030	Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.
320021000	I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.
320021001	
320021002	
320021003	
320021004	
320021005	
320021006	
320021007	
320021008	
320021009	
320021010	Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.
320030000	Greetings. Nice to see you again.
320030001	
320030002	
320030003	
320030004	
320030005	
320030006	
320030007	
320030008	
320030009	
320030010	My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner.
320030011	
320030012	
320030013	
320030014	
320030015	
320030016	
320030017	
320030018	
320030019	
320030020	Isn't this place impressive, though?
320030021	
320030022	
320030023	
320030024	
320030025	
320030026	
320030027	
320030028	
320030029	
320030030	The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
320030031	
320030032	
320030033	
320030034	
320030035	
320030036	
320030037	
320030038	
320030039	
320030040	I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.
320030041	
320030042	
320030043	
320030044	
320030045	
320030046	
320030047	
320030048	
320030049	
320030050	Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.
320030051	
320030052	
320030053	
320030054	
320030055	
320030056	
320030057	
320030058	
320030059	
320030060	I'm still looking for my own purpose.
320032000	You're telling me I possess some kind of gift?
320032001	
320032002	
320032003	
320032004	
320032005	
320032006	
320032007	
320032008	
320032009	
320032010	I don't believe you. But...
320032011	
320032012	
320032013	
320032014	
320032015	
320032016	
320032017	
320032018	
320032019	
320032020	If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...
320032021	
320032022	
320032023	
320032024	
320032025	
320032026	
320032027	
320032028	
320032029	
320032030	I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?
320032031	
320032032	
320032033	
320032034	
320032035	
320032036	
320032037	
320032038	
320032039	
320032040	I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.
320032041	
320032042	
320032043	
320032044	
320032045	
320032046	
320032047	
320032048	
320032049	
320032050	Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...
320032051	
320032052	
320032053	
320032054	
320032055	
320032056	
320032057	
320032058	
320032059	
320032060	But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...
320032061	
320032062	
320032063	
320032064	
320032065	
320032066	
320032067	
320032068	
320032069	
320032070	I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all.
320033000	Oh, and…
320033001	
320033002	
320033003	
320033004	
320033005	
320033006	
320033007	
320033008	
320033009	
320033010	Please, allow to me to express my thanks.
320033011	
320033012	
320033013	
320033014	
320033015	
320033016	
320033017	
320033018	
320033019	
320033020	For giving me that keepsake from my men.
320033021	
320033022	
320033023	
320033024	
320033025	
320033026	
320033027	
320033028	
320033029	
320033030	It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn.
320033031	
320033032	
320033033	
320033034	
320033035	
320033036	
320033037	
320033038	
320033039	
320033040	You have my gratitude. Please, take this.
320034000	A pleasure to meet you.
320034001	
320034002	
320034003	
320034004	
320034005	
320034006	
320034007	
320034008	
320034009	
320034010	My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival.
320034011	
320034012	
320034013	
320034014	
320034015	
320034016	
320034017	
320034018	
320034019	
320034020	Isn't this place impressive?
320034021	
320034022	
320034023	
320034024	
320034025	
320034026	
320034027	
320034028	
320034029	
320034030	The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
320034031	
320034032	
320034033	
320034034	
320034035	
320034036	
320034037	
320034038	
320034039	
320034040	I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.
320034041	
320034042	
320034043	
320034044	
320034045	
320034046	
320034047	
320034048	
320034049	
320034050	Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.
320034051	
320034052	
320034053	
320034054	
320034055	
320034056	
320034057	
320034058	
320034059	
320034060	I'm still looking for my own purpose.
320035000	It's all a bit much for me, in truth.
320035001	
320035002	
320035003	
320035004	
320035005	
320035006	
320035007	
320035008	
320035009	
320035010	I'm still looking for my own purpose.
320036000	A pleasure to see you.
320036001	
320036002	
320036003	
320036004	
320036005	
320036006	
320036007	
320036008	
320036009	
320036010	Thank goodness you're safe.
320036011	
320036012	
320036013	
320036014	
320036015	
320036016	
320036017	
320036018	
320036019	
320036020	I'm still looking for my own purpose.
320036021	
320036022	
320036023	
320036024	
320036025	
320036026	
320036027	
320036028	
320036029	
320036030	It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do.
320037000	If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise…
320037001	
320037002	
320037003	
320037004	
320037005	
320037006	
320037007	
320037008	
320037009	
320037010	I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?
320037011	
320037012	
320037013	
320037014	
320037015	
320037016	
320037017	
320037018	
320037019	
320037020	I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.
320040000	Good to see you again. Thank you very much!
320040001	
320040002	
320040003	
320040004	
320040005	
320040006	
320040007	
320040008	
320040009	
320040010	I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?
320040011	
320040012	
320040013	
320040014	
320040015	
320040016	
320040017	
320040018	
320040019	
320040020	I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.
320040021	
320040022	
320040023	
320040024	
320040025	
320040026	
320040027	
320040028	
320040029	
320040030	I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish,
320040031	
320040032	
320040033	
320040034	
320040035	
320040036	
320040037	
320040038	
320040039	
320040040	but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.
320040041	
320040042	
320040043	
320040044	
320040045	
320040046	
320040047	
320040048	
320040049	
320040050	And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted...
320040051	
320040052	
320040053	
320040054	
320040055	
320040056	
320040057	
320040058	
320040059	
320040060	Well, I certainly must try.
320040061	
320040062	
320040063	
320040064	
320040065	
320040066	
320040067	
320040068	
320040069	
320040070	Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
320050000	Greetings.
320050001	
320050002	
320050003	
320050004	
320050005	
320050006	
320050007	
320050008	
320050009	
320050010	Are you here for spirit tuning?
320051000	I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.
320051001	
320051002	
320051003	
320051004	
320051005	
320051006	
320051007	
320051008	
320051009	
320051010	I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order.
320051011	
320051012	
320051013	
320051014	
320051015	
320051016	
320051017	
320051018	
320051019	
320051020	I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...
320051021	
320051022	
320051023	
320051024	
320051025	
320051026	
320051027	
320051028	
320051029	
320051030	Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer.
320051031	
320051032	
320051033	
320051034	
320051035	
320051036	
320051037	
320051038	
320051039	
320051040	 
320051041	
320051042	
320051043	
320051044	
320051045	
320051046	
320051047	
320051048	
320051049	
320051050	Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner.
320052000	I'd like to ask you a small favour.
320052001	
320052002	
320052003	
320052004	
320052005	
320052006	
320052007	
320052008	
320052009	
320052010	Can you take this little one along with you?
320052011	
320052012	
320052013	
320052014	
320052015	
320052016	
320052017	
320052018	
320052019	
320052020	Can you take these little ones along with you?
320052021	
320052022	
320052023	
320052024	
320052025	
320052026	
320052027	
320052028	
320052029	
320052030	They can't be summoned here.
320052031	
320052032	
320052033	
320052034	
320052035	
320052036	
320052037	
320052038	
320052039	
320052040	But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
320052041	
320052042	
320052043	
320052044	
320052045	
320052046	
320052047	
320052048	
320052049	
320052050	It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.
320052051	
320052052	
320052053	
320052054	
320052055	
320052056	
320052057	
320052058	
320052059	
320052060	They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.
320053000	I need to warn you about something.
320053001	
320053002	
320053003	
320053004	
320053005	
320053006	
320053007	
320053008	
320053009	
320053010	A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.
320053011	
320053012	
320053013	
320053014	
320053015	
320053016	
320053017	
320053018	
320053019	
320053020	And I can hear, from all the way over there...
320053021	
320053022	
320053023	
320053024	
320053025	
320053026	
320053027	
320053028	
320053029	
320053030	The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...
320053031	
320053032	
320053033	
320053034	
320053035	
320053036	
320053037	
320053038	
320053039	
320053040	A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...
320053041	
320053042	
320053043	
320053044	
320053045	
320053046	
320053047	
320053048	
320053049	
320053050	I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...
320053051	
320053052	
320053053	
320053054	
320053055	
320053056	
320053057	
320053058	
320053059	
320053060	Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...
320053061	
320053062	
320053063	
320053064	
320053065	
320053066	
320053067	
320053068	
320053069	
320053070	You should keep your distance.
320053071	
320053072	
320053073	
320053074	
320053075	
320053076	
320053077	
320053078	
320053079	
320053080	I know you're strong, but please...
320054000	I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...
320054001	
320054002	
320054003	
320054004	
320054005	
320054006	
320054007	
320054008	
320054009	
320054010	The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...
320054011	
320054012	
320054013	
320054014	
320054015	
320054016	
320054017	
320054018	
320054019	
320054020	You should keep your distance.
320054021	
320054022	
320054023	
320054024	
320054025	
320054026	
320054027	
320054028	
320054029	
320054030	I know you're strong, but please...
320055000	I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse...
320055001	
320055002	
320055003	
320055004	
320055005	
320055006	
320055007	
320055008	
320055009	
320055010	I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.
320055011	
320055012	
320055013	
320055014	
320055015	
320055016	
320055017	
320055018	
320055019	
320055020	I just pray nothing ill comes of this.
320056000	Be on your guard, I beg you.
320056001	
320056002	
320056003	
320056004	
320056005	
320056006	
320056007	
320056008	
320056009	
320056010	He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.
320056011	
320056012	
320056013	
320056014	
320056015	
320056016	
320056017	
320056018	
320056019	
320056020	I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.
320056021	
320056022	
320056023	
320056024	
320056025	
320056026	
320056027	
320056028	
320056029	
320056030	And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.
320056031	
320056032	
320056033	
320056034	
320056035	
320056036	
320056037	
320056038	
320056039	
320056040	But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.
320056041	
320056042	
320056043	
320056044	
320056045	
320056046	
320056047	
320056048	
320056049	
320056050	I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.
320057000	The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again...
320057001	
320057002	
320057003	
320057004	
320057005	
320057006	
320057007	
320057008	
320057009	
320057010	But it isn't like last time.
320057011	
320057012	
320057013	
320057014	
320057015	
320057016	
320057017	
320057018	
320057019	
320057020	I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.
320057021	
320057022	
320057023	
320057024	
320057025	
320057026	
320057027	
320057028	
320057029	
320057030	Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?
320060000	Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.
320060001	
320060002	
320060003	
320060004	
320060005	
320060006	
320060007	
320060008	
320060009	
320060010	The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left.
320060011	
320060012	
320060013	
320060014	
320060015	
320060016	
320060017	
320060018	
320060019	
320060020	Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain.
320060021	
320060022	
320060023	
320060024	
320060025	
320060026	
320060027	
320060028	
320060029	
320060030	Don't worry, I don't blame you.
320060031	
320060032	
320060033	
320060034	
320060035	
320060036	
320060037	
320060038	
320060039	
320060040	I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before.
320060041	
320060042	
320060043	
320060044	
320060045	
320060046	
320060047	
320060048	
320060049	
320060050	Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.
320060051	
320060052	
320060053	
320060054	
320060055	
320060056	
320060057	
320060058	
320060059	
320060060	His roots are so knotted in this place.
320060061	
320060062	
320060063	
320060064	
320060065	
320060066	
320060067	
320060068	
320060069	
320060070	He won't last much longer if he stays here...
320060071	
320060072	
320060073	
320060074	
320060075	
320060076	
320060077	
320060078	
320060079	
320060080	His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now.
320060081	
320060082	
320060083	
320060084	
320060085	
320060086	
320060087	
320060088	
320060089	
320060090	It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him.
320061000	I see. You're here for some spirit tuning?
320070000	Oh, is that right...
320070001	
320070002	
320070003	
320070004	
320070005	
320070006	
320070007	
320070008	
320070009	
320070010	So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.
320070011	
320070012	
320070013	
320070014	
320070015	
320070016	
320070017	
320070018	
320070019	
320070020	You have my thanks, regardless.
320070021	
320070022	
320070023	
320070024	
320070025	
320070026	
320070027	
320070028	
320070029	
320070030	I'll try and talk him round next time.
320070031	
320070032	
320070033	
320070034	
320070035	
320070036	
320070037	
320070038	
320070039	
320070040	I know he was given this great entreaty;
320070041	
320070042	
320070043	
320070044	
320070045	
320070046	
320070047	
320070048	
320070049	
320070050	To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse.
320070051	
320070052	
320070053	
320070054	
320070055	
320070056	
320070057	
320070058	
320070059	
320070060	A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.
320070061	
320070062	
320070063	
320070064	
320070065	
320070066	
320070067	
320070068	
320070069	
320070070	And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do...
320080000	Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to...
320080001	
320080002	
320080003	
320080004	
320080005	
320080006	
320080007	
320080008	
320080009	
320080010	To think he'd forget who you were, as well.
320080011	
320080012	
320080013	
320080014	
320080015	
320080016	
320080017	
320080018	
320080019	
320080020	I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.
320080021	
320080022	
320080023	
320080024	
320080025	
320080026	
320080027	
320080028	
320080029	
320080030	I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.
320080031	
320080032	
320080033	
320080034	
320080035	
320080036	
320080037	
320080038	
320080039	
320080040	But maybe it's better that we don't.
320080041	
320080042	
320080043	
320080044	
320080045	
320080046	
320080047	
320080048	
320080049	
320080050	It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.
320081000	I'll remain with Hewg.
320081001	
320081002	
320081003	
320081004	
320081005	
320081006	
320081007	
320081008	
320081009	
320081010	He made me who I am today.
320081011	
320081012	
320081013	
320081014	
320081015	
320081016	
320081017	
320081018	
320081019	
320081020	I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can.
320082000	Please, become Elden Lord.
320082001	
320082002	
320082003	
320082004	
320082005	
320082006	
320082007	
320082008	
320082009	
320082010	Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.
320082011	
320082012	
320082013	
320082014	
320082015	
320082016	
320082017	
320082018	
320082019	
320082020	So slay her, with the weapons he smithed.
320082021	
320082022	
320082023	
320082024	
320082025	
320082026	
320082027	
320082028	
320082029	
320082030	Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all.
320090000	You're...giving it to me?
320090001	
320090002	
320090003	
320090004	
320090005	
320090006	
320090007	
320090008	
320090009	
320090010	I've never had alcohol before...
320090011	
320090012	
320090013	
320090014	
320090015	
320090016	
320090017	
320090018	
320090019	
320090020	I'm no longer a child. It's about time I took this step.
320091000	<sleeping>
320800000	You're willing to make me a chrysalid?
320801000	Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven...
320801001	
320801002	
320801003	
320801004	
320801005	
320801006	
320801007	
320801008	
320801009	
320801010	I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward...
320802000	Please. You're only wasting your strength.
320803000	I know how you must feel.
320803001	
320803002	
320803003	
320803004	
320803005	
320803006	
320803007	
320803008	
320803009	
320803010	But please, I'm not ready.
320804000	Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear...
320804001	
320804002	
320804003	
320804004	
320804005	
320804006	
320804007	
320804008	
320804009	
320804010	You've divested yourself of all reason?
320805000	Please, stop.
320805001	
320805002	
320805003	
320805004	
320805005	
320805006	
320805007	
320805008	
320805009	
320805010	Even if you persist, your fear will not abate.
321001000	Hello? Is anybody there?
321001001	
321001002	
321001003	
321001004	
321001005	
321001006	
321001007	
321001008	
321001009	
321001010	Someone who might be interested in rescuing the great Kenneth Haight?
321001011	
321001012	
321001013	
321001014	
321001015	
321001016	
321001017	
321001018	
321001019	
321001020	Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false!
321001021	
321001022	
321001023	
321001024	
321001025	
321001026	
321001027	
321001028	
321001029	
321001030	O Erdtree! Grant me succour!
321003000	What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?
321003001	
321003002	
321003003	
321003004	
321003005	
321003006	
321003007	
321003008	
321003009	
321003010	My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.
321003011	
321003012	
321003013	
321003014	
321003015	
321003016	
321003017	
321003018	
321003019	
321003020	Oh I see. You wish to know the reward?
321003021	
321003022	
321003023	
321003024	
321003025	
321003026	
321003027	
321003028	
321003029	
321003030	Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse.
321003031	
321003032	
321003033	
321003034	
321003035	
321003036	
321003037	
321003038	
321003039	
321003040	The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval.
321004000	Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice.
321004001	
321004002	
321004003	
321004004	
321004005	
321004006	
321004007	
321004008	
321004009	
321004010	I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes.
321004011	
321004012	
321004013	
321004014	
321004015	
321004016	
321004017	
321004018	
321004019	
321004020	That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting".
321004021	
321004022	
321004023	
321004024	
321004025	
321004026	
321004027	
321004028	
321004029	
321004030	Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.
321004031	
321004032	
321004033	
321004034	
321004035	
321004036	
321004037	
321004038	
321004039	
321004040	First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle...
321004041	
321004042	
321004043	
321004044	
321004045	
321004046	
321004047	
321004048	
321004049	
321004050	Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.
321004051	
321004052	
321004053	
321004054	
321004055	
321004056	
321004057	
321004058	
321004059	
321004060	Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse?
321004061	
321004062	
321004063	
321004064	
321004065	
321004066	
321004067	
321004068	
321004069	
321004070	And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him.
321004071	
321004072	
321004073	
321004074	
321004075	
321004076	
321004077	
321004078	
321004079	
321004080	I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it.
321005000	What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?
321005001	
321005002	
321005003	
321005004	
321005005	
321005006	
321005007	
321005008	
321005009	
321005010	My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.
321010000	Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you?
321010001	
321010002	
321010003	
321010004	
321010005	
321010006	
321010007	
321010008	
321010009	
321010010	Well, that's very kind, but, um...
321010011	
321010012	
321010013	
321010014	
321010015	
321010016	
321010017	
321010018	
321010019	
321010020	No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.
321010021	
321010022	
321010023	
321010024	
321010025	
321010026	
321010027	
321010028	
321010029	
321010030	Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.
321010031	
321010032	
321010033	
321010034	
321010035	
321010036	
321010037	
321010038	
321010039	
321010040	You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.
321010041	
321010042	
321010043	
321010044	
321010045	
321010046	
321010047

321010049	
321010050	Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.
321010051	
321010052	
321010053	
321010054	
321010055	
321010056	
321010057	
321010058	
321010059	
321010060	I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.
321010061	
321010062	
321010063	
321010064	
321010065	
321010066	
321010067	
321010068	
321010069	
321010070	A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood!

321014017	
321014018	
321014019	
321014020	A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one.
321014021

321014023	
321014024	
321014025

321014027

321014034	
321014035

321014037	
321014038	
321014039	
321014040	I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you.
321014041	
321014042	
321014043	
321014044	
321014045	
321014046	
321014047	
321014048	
321014049	
321014050	Now, this is your reward.
321014051	
321014052	
321014053	
321014054	
321014055	
321014056	
321014057	
321014058	
321014059	
321014060	Go on, it is yours, for the keeping.
321020000	Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath!
321020001	
321020002	
321020003	
321020004

321020006	
321020007	
321020008	
321020009	
321020010	Did you manage to recapture my fort?
321020011	
321020012	
321020013	
321020014	
321020015	
321020016	
321020017	
321020018	
321020019	
321020020	Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot!
321020021	
321020022	
321020023	
321020024	
321020025	
321020026	
321020027	
321020028	
321020029	
321020030	Well done my friend, well done indeed!
321020031	
321020032	
321020033	
321020034	
321020035	
321020036	
321020037	
321020038	
321020039	
321020040	I knew I was right to trust you!
321020041	
321020042	
321020043	
321020044	
321020045	
321020046	
321020047	
321020048	
321020049	
321020050	Now, here's your reward, as promised.
321020051	
321020052	
321020053	
321020054	
321020055	
321020056	
321020057	
321020058	
321020059	
321020060	Go ahead, it's all yours.
321021000	Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.
321021001	
321021002	
321021003	
321021004	
321021005	
321021006	
321021007	
321021008	
321021009	
321021010	I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.
321021011	
321021012	
321021013	
321021014	
321021015	
321021016	
321021017	
321021018	
321021019	
321021020	What's that look? You don't believe me?
321021021	
321021022	
321021023	
321021024	
321021025	
321021026	
321021027	
321021028	
321021029	
321021030	Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible.
321021031	
321021032	
321021033	
321021034	
321021035	
321021036	
321021037	
321021038	
321021039	
321021040	Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order.
321021041	
321021042	
321021043	
321021044	
321021045	
321021046	
321021047	
321021048	
321021049	
321021050	Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it.
321021051	
321021052	
321021053	
321021054	
321021055	
321021056	
321021057	
321021058	
321021059	
321021060	Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch.
321022000	Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask.
321022001	
321022002	
321022003	
321022004	
321022005	
321022006	
321022007	
321022008	
321022009	
321022010	Would you like to enter my service?
321022011	
321022012	
321022013	
321022014	
321022015	
321022016	
321022017	
321022018	
321022019	
321022020	I see bright things in your future, stout warrior.
321022021	
321022022	
321022023	
321022024	
321022025	
321022026	
321022027	
321022028	
321022029	
321022030	Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order.
321022031	
321022032	
321022033	
321022034	
321022035	
321022036	
321022037	
321022038	
321022039	
321022040	And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours.
321022041	
321022042	
321022043	
321022044	
321022045	
321022046	
321022047	
321022048	
321022049	
321022050	What say you? A fine accord, is it not?
321023000	Very well. Very well, indeed.
321023001	
321023002	
321023003	
321023004	
321023005	
321023006	
321023007	
321023008	
321023009	
321023010	I knew I saw something in you.
321023011	
321023012	
321023013	
321023014	
321023015	
321023016	
321023017	
321023018	
321023019	
321023020	I shall await you at my fort.
321023021	
321023022	
321023023	
321023024	
321023025	
321023026	
321023027	
321023028	
321023029	
321023030	We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think.
321023031	
321023032	
321023033	
321023034	
321023035	
321023036	
321023037	
321023038	
321023039	
321023040	I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.
321024000	Excuse me?
321024001	
321024002	
321024003	
321024004	
321024005	
321024006	
321024007	
321024008	
321024009	
321024010	Such foolishness have I never seen!
321024011	
321024012	
321024013	
321024014	
321024015	
321024016	
321024017	
321024018	
321024019	
321024020	Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.
321024021	
321024022	
321024023	
321024024	
321024025	
321024026	
321024027	
321024028	
321024029	
321024030	Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.
321024031	
321024032	
321024033	
321024034	
321024035	
321024036	
321024037	
321024038	
321024039	
321024040	Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.
321025000	What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest?
321026000	Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.
321026001	
321026002	
321026003	
321026004	
321026005	
321026006	
321026007	
321026008	
321026009	
321026010	Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.
321026011	
321026012	
321026013	
321026014	
321026015	
321026016	
321026017	
321026018	
321026019	
321026020	Oh don't fret, there's no hurry.
321026021	
321026022	
321026023	
321026024	
321026025	
321026026	
321026027	
321026028	
321026029	
321026030	Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.
321040000	Why...
321040001	
321040002	
321040003	
321040004	
321040005	
321040006	
321040007	
321040008	
321040009	
321040010	Why the queen... Now all hope is...
321040011	
321040012	
321040013	
321040014	
321040015	
321040016	
321040017	
321040018	
321040019	
321040020	(dies)
321050000	Ah, you, is it?
321050001	
321050002	
321050003	
321050004	
321050005	
321050006	
321050007	
321050008	
321050009	
321050010	I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort?
321050011	
321050012	
321050013	
321050014	
321050015	
321050016	
321050017	
321050018	
321050019	
321050020	Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler.
321050021	
321050022	
321050023	
321050024	
321050025	
321050026	
321050027	
321050028	
321050029	
321050030	One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.
321050031	
321050032	
321050033	
321050034	
321050035	
321050036	
321050037	
321050038	
321050039	
321050040	But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
321051000	I am sorry to have lifted your hopes...
321051001	
321051002	
321051003	
321051004

321051010	But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand.
321051011	
321051012	
321051013	
321051014	
321051015	
321051016	
321051017	
321051018	
321051019	
321051020	The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology.
321051021	
321051022	
321051023	
321051024	
321051025	
321051026	
321051027	
321051028	
321051029	
321051030	But now, I must begin my search post-haste.
321051031	
321051032	
321051033	
321051034	
321051035	
321051036	
321051037	
321051038	
321051039	
321051040	For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
321052000	I must begin my search post-haste.
321052001	
321052002	
321052003	
321052004	
321052005	
321052006	
321052007	
321052008	
321052009	
321052010	For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
321060000	Ah, nice to see you after so long.
321060001	
321060002	
321060003	
321060004	
321060005	
321060006	
321060007	
321060008	
321060009	
321060010	Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good.
321060011	
321060012	
321060013	
321060014	
321060015	
321060016	
321060017	
321060018	
321060019	
321060020	Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler.
321060021	
321060022	
321060023	
321060024	
321060025	
321060026	
321060027	
321060028	
321060029	
321060030	Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage.
321060031	
321060032	
321060033	
321060034	
321060035	
321060036	
321060037	
321060038	
321060039	
321060040	Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less.
321060041	
321060042	
321060043	
321060044	
321060045	
321060046	
321060047	
321060048	
321060049	
321060050	For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.
321060051	
321060052	
321060053	
321060054	
321060055	
321060056	
321060057	
321060058	
321060059	
321060060	At which time I can fulfil my old promise.
321060061	
321060062	
321060063	
321060064	
321060065	
321060066	
321060067	
321060068	
321060069	
321060070	By raising you to the glory of knighthood.
321060071	
321060072	
321060073	
321060074	
321060075	
321060076	
321060077	
321060078	
321060079	
321060080	I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.
321061000	For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.
321061001	
321061002	
321061003	
321061004	
321061005	
321061006	
321061007	
321061008	
321061009	
321061010	At which time I can fulfil my old promise.
321061011	
321061012	
321061013	
321061014	
321061015	
321061016	
321061017	
321061018	
321061019	
321061020	By raising you to the glory of knighthood.
321061021	
321061022	
321061023	
321061024	
321061025	
321061026	
321061027	
321061028	
321061029	
321061030	I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.
321800000	Oof!
321801000	Goodness gracious!
321801001	
321801002	
321801003	
321801004	
321801005	
321801006	
321801007	
321801008	
321801009	
321801010	Calm yourself, this instant!
321801011	
321801012	
321801013	
321801014	
321801015	
321801016	
321801017	
321801018	
321801019	
321801020	Enough! This is madness!
321802000	Blast! You wretched Tarnished!
321802001	
321802002	
321802003	
321802004	
321802005	
321802006	
321802007	
321802008	
321802009	
321802010	I am Kenneth Haight, and I have seen quite enough!
321803000	The madness leaves nothing untouched.
321803001	
321803002	
321803003	
321803004	
321803005	
321803006	
321803007	
321803008	
321803009	
321803010	I fear for the integrity of the Order...
321804000	Where are my...men...?
321804001	
321804002	
321804003	
321804004	
321804005	
321804006	
321804007	
321804008	
321804009	
321804010	O Erdtree, why have you forsaken me...?
321900000	 
321900001	
321900002	
321900003	
321900004	
321900005	
321900006	
321900007	
321900008	
321900009	
321900010	 
321900011	
321900012	
321900013	
321900014	
321900015	
321900016	
321900017	
321900018	
321900019	
321900020	 
322001000	Greetings, great champion called by grace.
322001001	
322001002	
322001003	
322001004	
322001005	
322001006	
322001007	
322001008	
322001009	
322001010	I am Fia.
322001011	
322001012	
322001013	
322001014	
322001015	
322001016	
322001017	
322001018	
322001019	
322001020	Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold.
322001021	
322001022	
322001023	
322001024	
322001025	
322001026	
322001027	
322001028	
322001029	
322001030	Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?
322001031	
322001032	
322001033	
322001034	
322001035	
322001036	
322001037	
322001038	
322001039	
322001040	Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.
322001041	
322001042	
322001043	
322001044	
322001045	
322001046	
322001047	
322001048	
322001049	
322001050	Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion.
322001051	
322001052	
322001053	
322001054	
322001055	
322001056	
322001057	
322001058	
322001059	
322001060	And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.
322001061	
322001062	
322001063	
322001064	
322001065	
322001066	
322001067	
322001068	
322001069	
322001070	Do you think it vulgar, perhaps?
322001071	
322001072	
322001073	
322001074	
322001075	
322001076	
322001077	
322001078	
322001079	
322001080	Where I come from, it is a sacred act.
322002000	Ah, my thanks, great champion.
322002001	
322002002	
322002003	
322002004	
322002005	
322002006	
322002007	
322002008	
322002009	
322002010	You are...very warm...
322002011	
322002012	
322002013	
322002014	
322002015	
322002016	
322002017	
322002018	
322002019	
322002020	What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing.
322002021	
322002022	
322002023	
322002024	
322002025	
322002026	
322002027	
322002028	
322002029	
322002030	Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.
322002031	
322002032	
322002033	
322002034	
322002035	
322002036	
322002037	
322002038	
322002039	
322002040	Come back to me, should you require another.
322002041	
322002042	
322002043	
322002044	
322002045	
322002046	
322002047	
322002048	
322002049	
322002050	I will take you in my arms as often as you need.
322003000	I understand.
322003001	
322003002	
322003003	
322003004	
322003005	
322003006	
322003007	
322003008	
322003009	
322003010	Your disdain is only natural.
322003011	
322003012	
322003013	
322003014	
322003015	
322003016	
322003017	
322003018	
322003019	
322003020	But should you change your mind...
322003021	
322003022	
322003023	
322003024	
322003025	
322003026	
322003027	
322003028	
322003029	
322003030	Come pay me another visit.
322004000	Oh, my dear...
322004001	
322004002	
322004003	
322004004	
322004005	
322004006	
322004007	
322004008	
322004009	
322004010	Had a change of heart already?
322005000	I am pleased to see you again.
322005001	
322005002	
322005003	
322005004	
322005005	
322005006	
322005007	
322005008	
322005009	
322005010	Would you like me to hold you, once more?
322005011	
322005012	
322005013	
322005014	
322005015	
322005016	
322005017	
322005018	
322005019	
322005020	The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear.
322005021	
322005022	
322005023	
322005024	
322005025	
322005026	
322005027	
322005028	
322005029	
322005030	Would you like to be held, regardless?
322006000	Now, come closer...
322006001	
322006002	
322006003	
322006004	
322006005	
322006006	
322006007	
322006008	
322006009	
322006010	You are so...very warm...
322007000	Then good day to you, my dear.
322020000	I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.
322020001	
322020002	
322020003	
322020004	
322020005	
322020006	
322020007	
322020008	
322020009	
322020010	After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions,
322020011	
322020012	
322020013	
322020014	
322020015	
322020016	
322020017	
322020018	
322020019	
322020020	I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.
322020021	
322020022	
322020023	
322020024	
322020025	
322020026	
322020027	
322020028	
322020029	
322020030	To do so is the purpose of my being.
322020031	
322020032	
322020033	
322020034	
322020035	
322020036	
322020037	
322020038	
322020039	
322020040	But before I could bear the noble into new life,
322020041	
322020042	
322020043	
322020044	
322020045	
322020046	
322020047	
322020048	
322020049	
322020050	I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.
322020051	
322020052	
322020053	
322020054	
322020055	
322020056	
322020057	
322020058	
322020059	
322020060	Pray, be kind.
322020061	
322020062	
322020063	
322020064	
322020065	
322020066	
322020067	
322020068	
322020069	
322020070	Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.
322020071	
322020072	
322020073	
322020074	
322020075	
322020076	
322020077	
322020078	
322020079	
322020080	So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.
322021000	My dear...
322021001	
322021002	
322021003	
322021004	
322021005	
322021006	
322021007	
322021008	
322021009	
322021010	Might I ask something of you?
322021011	
322021012	
322021013	
322021014	
322021015	
322021016	
322021017	
322021018	
322021019	
322021020	Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them?
322021021	
322021022	
322021023	
322021024	
322021025	
322021026	
322021027	
322021028	
322021029	
322021030	A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.
322021031	
322021032	
322021033	
322021034	
322021035	
322021036	
322021037	
322021038	
322021039	
322021040	It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.
322021041	
322021042	
322021043	
322021044	
322021045	
322021046	
322021047	
322021048	
322021049	
322021050	So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind.
322022000	I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them.
322022001	
322022002	
322022003	
322022004	
322022005	
322022006	
322022007	
322022008	
322022009	
322022010	It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.
322023000	My dear...
322023001	
322023002	
322023003	
322023004	
322023005	
322023006	
322023007	
322023008	
322023009	
322023010	Have you ever heard of black knifeprints?
322023011	
322023012	
322023013	
322023014	
322023015	
322023016	
322023017	
322023018	
322023019	
322023020	Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed.
322023021	
322023022	
322023023	
322023024	
322023025	
322023026	
322023027	
322023028	
322023029	
322023030	And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.
322023031	
322023032	
322023033	
322023034	
322023035	
322023036	
322023037	
322023038	
322023039	
322023040	The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,
322023041	
322023042	
322023043	
322023044	
322023045	
322023046	
322023047	
322023048	
322023049	
322023050	along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.
322023051	
322023052	
322023053	
322023054	
322023055	
322023056	
322023057	
322023058	
322023059	
322023060	These grand affairs are hardly my forté...
322023061	
322023062	
322023063	
322023064	
322023065	
322023066	
322023067	
322023068	
322023069	
322023070	But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...
322024000	Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed.
322024001	
322024002	
322024003	
322024004	
322024005	
322024006	
322024007	
322024008	
322024009	
322024010	The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.
322024011	
322024012	
322024013	
322024014	
322024015	
322024016	
322024017	
322024018	
322024019	
322024020	The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,
322024021	
322024022	
322024023	
322024024	
322024025	
322024026	
322024027	
322024028	
322024029	
322024030	along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.
322025000	I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier.
322025001	
322025002	
322025003	
322025004	
322025005	
322025006	
322025007	
322025008	
322025009	
322025010	He seemed positively elated.
322025011	
322025012	
322025013	
322025014	
322025015	
322025016	
322025017	
322025018	
322025019	
322025020	He must be possessed of great mental fortitude.
322025021	
322025022	
322025023	
322025024	
322025025	
322025026	
322025027	
322025028	
322025029	
322025030	It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds.
322025031	
322025032	
322025033	
322025034	
322025035	
322025036	
322025037	
322025038	
322025039	
322025040	You truly are a champion.
322025041	
322025042	
322025043	
322025044	
322025045	
322025046	
322025047	
322025048	
322025049	
322025050	To dear Rogier, and myself, too.
322026000	
322026001	
322026002	
322026003	
322026004	
322026005	
322026006	
322026007	
322026008	
322026009	
322026010	
322026011	
322026012	
322026013	
322026014	
322026015	
322026016	
322026017	
322026018	
322026019	
322026020	
322026021	
322026022	
322026023	
322026024	
322026025	
322026026	
322026027	
322026028	
322026029	
322026030	
322027000	In truth I've heard tell from someone else,
322027001	
322027002	
322027003	
322027004	
322027005	
322027006	
322027007	
322027008	
322027009	
322027010	about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.
322027011	
322027012	
322027013	
322027014	
322027015	
322027016	
322027017	
322027018	
322027019	
322027020	But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold.
322027021	
322027022	
322027023	
322027024	
322027025	
322027026	
322027027	
322027028	
322027029	
322027030	Perhaps you could make use of it?
322030000	Finally, it is returned to its rightful place.
322030001	
322030002	
322030003	
322030004	
322030005	
322030006	
322030007	
322030008	
322030009	
322030010	The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble.
322030011	
322030012	
322030013	
322030014	
322030015	
322030016	
322030017	
322030018	
322030019	
322030020	And now, I must bid you goodbye as well.
322030021	
322030022	
322030023	
322030024	
322030025	
322030026	
322030027	
322030028	
322030029	
322030030	Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold.
322030031	
322030032	
322030033	
322030034	
322030035	
322030036	
322030037	
322030038	
322030039	
322030040	I am Fia, Deathbed Companion.
322030041	
322030042	
322030043	
322030044	
322030045	
322030046	
322030047	
322030048	
322030049	
322030050	Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted.
322030051	
322030052	
322030053	
322030054	
322030055	
322030056	
322030057	
322030058	
322030059	
322030060	We, who humbly live in Death...
322030061	
322030062	
322030063	
322030064	
322030065	
322030066	
322030067	
322030068	
322030069	
322030070	Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord.
322030071	
322030072	
322030073	
322030074	
322030075	
322030076	
322030077	
322030078	
322030079	
322030080	What right does anyone have to object?
322030081	
322030082	
322030083	
322030084	
322030085	
322030086	
322030087	
322030088	
322030089	
322030090	Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek.
322040000	Ah...there you are.
322040001	
322040002	
322040003	
322040004	
322040005	
322040006	
322040007	
322040008	
322040009	
322040010	I knew you would come.
322040011	
322040012	
322040013	
322040014	
322040015	
322040016	
322040017	
322040018	
322040019	
322040020	What is it you intend?
322040021	
322040022	
322040023	
322040024	
322040025	
322040026	
322040027	
322040028	
322040029	
322040030	To deny us, and our ways?
322040031	
322040032	
322040033	
322040034	
322040035	
322040036	
322040037	
322040038	
322040039	
322040040	Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order?
322041000	I see. Then you must kill me.
322041001	
322041002	
322041003	
322041004	
322041005	
322041006	
322041007	
322041008	
322041009	
322041010	For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death.
322041011	
322041012	
322041013	
322041014	
322041015	
322041016	
322041017	
322041018	
322041019	
322041020	I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death.
322041021	
322041022	
322041023	
322041024	
322041025	
322041026	
322041027	
322041028	
322041029	
322041030	So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them...
322041031	
322041032	
322041033	
322041034	
322041035	
322041036	
322041037	
322041038	
322041039	
322041040	I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh.
322042000	Go on, kill me.
322042001	
322042002	
322042003	
322042004	
322042005	
322042006	
322042007	
322042008	
322042009	
322042010	You deny us, do you not?
322042011	
322042012	
322042013	
322042014	
322042015	
322042016	
322042017	
322042018	
322042019	
322042020	Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory.
322043000	You are an odd one.
322043001	
322043002	
322043003	
322043004	
322043005	
322043006	
322043007	
322043008	
322043009	
322043010	I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death.
322043011	
322043012	
322043013	
322043014	
322043015	
322043016	
322043017	
322043018	
322043019	
322043020	They call me a foul and rotten witch.
322043021	
322043022	
322043023	
322043024	
322043025	
322043026	
322043027	
322043028	
322043029	
322043030	Yet you still wish to be held by me?
322044000	I will soon lay with Godwyn.
322044001	
322044002	
322044003	
322044004	
322044005	
322044006	
322044007	
322044008	
322044009	
322044010	And it will surely stir within me.
322044011	
322044012	
322044013	
322044014	
322044015	
322044016	
322044017	
322044018	
322044019	
322044020	the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods,
322044021	
322044022	
322044023	
322044024	
322044025	
322044026	
322044027	
322044028	
322044029	
322044030	as the rune of Those Who Live in Death.
322044031	
322044032	
322044033	
322044034	
322044035	
322044036	
322044037	
322044038	
322044039	
322044040	Please, do one thing for me.
322044041	
322044042	
322044043	
322044044	
322044045	
322044046	
322044047	
322044048	
322044049	
322044050	Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne.
322044051	
322044052	
322044053	
322044054	
322044055	
322044056	
322044057	
322044058	
322044059	
322044060	Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.
322044061	
322044062	
322044063	
322044064	
322044065	
322044066	
322044067	
322044068	
322044069	
322044070	By becoming our Elden Lord.
322045000	I will soon lay with Godwyn.
322045001	
322045002	
322045003	
322045004	
322045005	
322045006	
322045007	
322045008	
322045009	
322045010	To conceive my child, the rune.
322045011	
322045012	
322045013	
322045014	
322045015	
322045016	
322045017	
322045018	
322045019	
322045020	Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne.
322045021	
322045022	
322045023	
322045024	
322045025	
322045026	
322045027	
322045028	
322045029	
322045030	Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.
322045031	
322045032	
322045033	
322045034	
322045035

322045037	
322045038	
322045039	
322045040	By becoming our Elden Lord.
322046000	This is goodbye, my dear.
322046001	
322046002	
322046003	
322046004	
322046005	
322046006	
322046007	
322046008	
322046009	
322046010	But I am satisfied.
322046011	
322046012	
322046013	
322046014	
322046015	
322046016	
322046017	
322046018	
322046019	
322046020	I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me.
322046021	
322046022	
322046023	
322046024	
322046025	
322046026	
322046027	
322046028	
322046029	
322046030	And I will bear a child.
322046031	
322046032	
322046033	
322046034	
322046035	
322046036	
322046037	
322046038	
322046039	
322046040	Who will inherit your warmth, too.
322046041	
322046042	
322046043	
322046044	
322046045	
322046046	
322046047	
322046048	
322046049	
322046050	What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion?
322050000	
322050001	
322050002	
322050003	
322050004	
322050005	
322050006	
322050007	
322050008	
322050009	
322050010	
322050011	
322050012	
322050013	
322050014	
322050015	
322050016	
322050017	
322050018	
322050019	
322050020	
322050021	
322050022	
322050023	
322050024	
322050025	
322050026	
322050027	
322050028	
322050029	
322050030	
322051000	Have you ever seen a hallowbrand?
322051001	
322051002	
322051003	
322051004	
322051005	
322051006	
322051007	
322051008	
322051009	
322051010	When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
322051011	
322051012	
322051013	
322051014	
322051015	
322051016	
322051017	
322051018	
322051019	
322051020	Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold.
322051021	
322051022	
322051023	
322051024	
322051025	
322051026	
322051027	
322051028	
322051029	
322051030	But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere.
322051031	
322051032	
322051033	
322051034	
322051035	
322051036	
322051037	
322051038	
322051039	
322051040	And I must find it.
322051041	
322051042	
322051043	
322051044	
322051045	
322051046	
322051047	
322051048	
322051049	
322051050	Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
322052000	When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.
322052001	
322052002	
322052003	
322052004	
322052005	
322052006	
322052007	
322052008	
322052009	
322052010	But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
322052011	
322052012	
322052013	
322052014	
322052015	
322052016	
322052017	
322052018	
322052019	
322052020	And I must find it.
322052021	
322052022	
322052023	
322052024	
322052025	
322052026	
322052027	
322052028	
322052029	
322052030	Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
322052031	
322052032	
322052033	
322052034	
322052035	
322052036	
322052037	
322052038	
322052039	
322052040	My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed.
322052041	
322052042	
322052043	
322052044	
322052045	
322052046	
322052047	
322052048	
322052049	
322052050	Will you still let me hold you, even then?
322053000	When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.
322053001	
322053002	
322053003	
322053004	
322053005	
322053006	
322053007	
322053008	
322053009	
322053010	But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
322053011	
322053012	
322053013	
322053014	
322053015	
322053016	
322053017	
322053018	
322053019	
322053020	And I must find it.
322053021	
322053022	
322053023	
322053024	
322053025	
322053026	
322053027	
322053028	
322053029	
322053030	Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
322054000	...!
322054001	
322054002	
322054003	
322054004	
322054005	
322054006	
322054007	
322054008	
322054009	
322054010	This...is the other hallowbrand.
322054011	
322054012	
322054013	
322054014	
322054015	
322054016	
322054017	
322054018	
322054019	
322054020	How did you...
322054021	
322054022	
322054023	
322054024	
322054025	
322054026	
322054027	
322054028	
322054029	
322054030	Oh, my utmost thanks.
322054031	
322054032	
322054033	
322054034	
322054035	
322054036	
322054037	
322054038	
322054039	
322054040	With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead.
322054041	
322054042	
322054043	
322054044	
322054045	
322054046	
322054047	
322054048	
322054049	
322054050	And claim a second, illustrious life.
322054051	
322054052	
322054053	
322054054	
322054055	
322054056	
322054057	
322054058	
322054059	
322054060	You are my-- our true champion.
322054061	
322054062	
322054063	
322054064	
322054065	
322054066	
322054067	
322054068	
322054069	
322054070	And though I can't be of any use to you...
322054071	
322054072	
322054073	
322054074	
322054075	
322054076	
322054077	
322054078	
322054079	
322054080	Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment?
322800000	Godwyn...
322800001	
322800002	
322800003	
322800004	
322800005	
322800006	
322800007	
322800008	
322800009	
322800010	Is that you, dear?
322801000	Will your kind never stop?
322801001	
322801002	
322801003	
322801004	
322801005	
322801006	
322801007	
322801008	
322801009	
322801010	Ravaging...the weak?
322900000	 
322900001	
322900002	
322900003	
322900004	
322900005	
322900006	
322900007	
322900008	
322900009	
322900010	 
323001000	Have you ever felt the curse, with your whole being?
323001001	
323001002	
323001003	
323001004	
323001005	
323001006	
323001007	
323001008	
323001009	
323001010	The pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all. The reviled blessing.
323001011	
323001012	
323001013	
323001014	
323001015	
323001016	
323001017	
323001018	
323001019	
323001020	...
323001021	
323001022	
323001023	
323001024	
323001025	
323001026	
323001027	
323001028	
323001029	
323001030	Apparently not.
323001031	
323001032	
323001033	
323001034	
323001035	
323001036	
323001037	
323001038	
323001039	
323001040	You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant of your own ignorance.
323001041	
323001042	
323001043	
323001044	
323001045	
323001046	
323001047	
323001048	
323001049	
323001050	You no longer interest me.
323001051	
323001052	
323001053	
323001054	
323001055	
323001056	
323001057	
323001058	
323001059	
323001060	I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude.
323002000	I asked you not to disturb me.
323002001	
323002002	
323002003	
323002004	
323002005	
323002006	
323002007	
323002008	
323002009	
323002010	Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.
323002011	
323002012	
323002013	
323002014	
323002015	
323002016	
323002017	
323002018	
323002019	
323002020	It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.
323010000	No, wait.
323010001	
323010002	
323010003	
323010004	
323010005	
323010006	
323010007	
323010008	
323010009	
323010010	...
323010011	
323010012	
323010013	
323010014	
323010015	
323010016	
323010017	
323010018	
323010019	
323010020	You have felt the curse.
323010021	
323010022	
323010023	
323010024	
323010025	
323010026	
323010027	
323010028	
323010029	
323010030	I can smell it on you. The pox, yet tender.
323010031	
323010032	
323010033	
323010034	
323010035	
323010036	
323010037	
323010038	
323010039	
323010040	Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting.
323010041	
323010042	
323010043	
323010044	
323010045	
323010046	
323010047	
323010048	
323010049	
323010050	Twas a brief respite, I must say.
323010051	
323010052	
323010053	
323010054	
323010055	
323010056	
323010057	
323010058	
323010059	
323010060	Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.
323010061	
323010062	
323010063	
323010064	
323010065	
323010066	
323010067	
323010068	
323010069	
323010070	Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.
323010071	
323010072	
323010073	
323010074	
323010075	
323010076	
323010077	
323010078	
323010079	
323010080	I can kill you, and defile your corpse.
323010081	
323010082	
323010083	
323010084	
323010085	
323010086	
323010087	
323010088	
323010089	
323010090	Then the pox will truly be your own.
323011000	Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.
323011001	
323011002	
323011003	
323011004	
323011005	
323011006	
323011007	
323011008	
323011009	
323011010	Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.
323011011	
323011012	
323011013	
323011014	
323011015	
323011016	
323011017	
323011018	
323011019	
323011020	I can kill you, and defile your corpse.
323011021	
323011022	
323011023	
323011024	
323011025	
323011026	
323011027	
323011028	
323011029	
323011030	Then the pox will truly be your own.
323020000	...
323020001	
323020002	
323020003	
323020004	
323020005	
323020006	
323020007	
323020008	
323020009	
323020010	Let me out! Let me out of here!
323020011	
323020012	
323020013	
323020014	
323020015	
323020016	
323020017	
323020018	
323020019	
323020020	Must eat more! Defile more!
323020021	
323020022	
323020023	
323020024	
323020025	
323020026	
323020027	
323020028	
323020029	
323020030	Everything that matters to you!
323020031	
323020032	
323020033	
323020034	
323020035	
323020036	
323020037	
323020038	
323020039	
323020040	For generations to come!

323020044	
323020045	
323020046	
323020047	
323020048	
323020049	
323020050	I am the Dung Eater!
323020051	
323020052	
323020053	
323020054	
323020055	
323020056	
323020057	
323020058	
323020059	
323020060	A scourge upon the living!
323021000	Who are you?
323022000	I've been here long enough.
323022001	
323022002	
323022003	
323022004	
323022005	
323022006	
323022007	
323022008	
323022009	
323022010	I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.
323022011	
323022012	
323022013	
323022014	
323022015	
323022016	
323022017	
323022018	
323022019	
323022020	Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…
323022021	
323022022	
323022023	
323022024	
323022025	
323022026	
323022027	
323022028	
323022029	
323022030	They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…
323023000	I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.
323023001	
323023002	
323023003	
323023004	
323023005	
323023006	
323023007	
323023008	
323023009	
323023010	Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…
323023011	
323023012	
323023013	
323023014	
323023015	
323023016	
323023017	
323023018	
323023019	
323023020	They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…
323024000	I am the Dung Eater.
323024001	
323024002	
323024003	
323024004	
323024005	
323024006	
323024007	
323024008	
323024009	
323024010	A scourge upon the living.
323024011	
323024012	
323024013	
323024014	
323024015	
323024016	
323024017	
323024018	
323024019	
323024020	I must eat more. Defile more...
323025000	Let me out. Let me out of here.
323030000	I will kill you, and defile your corpse.
323030001	
323030002	
323030003	
323030004	
323030005	
323030006	
323030007	
323030008	
323030009	
323030010	Then the pox will truly be your own.
323031000	I'll give you a good blessing.
323031001	
323031002	
323031003	
323031004	
323031005	
323031006	
323031007	
323031008	
323031009	
323031010	You'll be nourishment for the pox.
323040000	There you are.
323040001	
323040002	
323040003	
323040004	
323040005	
323040006	
323040007	
323040008	
323040009	
323040010	You warded off my blessing.
323040011	
323040012	
323040013	
323040014	
323040015	
323040016	
323040017	
323040018	
323040019	
323040020	Despite the curse stirring within you.
323040021	
323040022	
323040023	
323040024	
323040025	
323040026	
323040027	
323040028	
323040029	
323040030	No one has succeeded in that before.
323040031	
323040032	
323040033	
323040034	
323040035	
323040036	
323040037	
323040038	
323040039	
323040040	How? I thought. Then it hit me.
323040041	
323040042	
323040043	
323040044	
323040045	
323040046	
323040047	
323040048	
323040049	
323040050	That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater.
323040051	
323040052	
323040053	
323040054	
323040055	
323040056	
323040057	
323040058	
323040059	
323040060	It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.
323041000	Give me your blessing.
323041001	
323041002	
323041003	
323041004	
323041005	
323041006	
323041007	
323041008	
323041009	
323041010	Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.
323041011	
323041012	
323041013	
323041014	
323041015	
323041016	
323041017	
323041018	
323041019	
323041020	Again and again. Until it is done.
323041021	
323041022	
323041023	
323041024	
323041025	
323041026	
323041027	
323041028	
323041029	
323041030	Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.
323041031	
323041032	
323041033	
323041034	
323041035	
323041036	
323041037	
323041038	
323041039	
323041040	Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled.
323041041	
323041042	
323041043	
323041044	
323041045	
323041046	
323041047	
323041048	
323041049	
323041050	And soon the fruits will be borne.
323041051	
323041052	
323041053	
323041054	
323041055	
323041056	
323041057	
323041058	
323041059	
323041060	Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more.
323041061	
323041062	
323041063	
323041064	
323041065	
323041066	
323041067	
323041068	
323041069	
323041070	A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead!
323041071	
323041072	
323041073	
323041074	
323041075	
323041076	
323041077	
323041078	
323041079	
323041080	The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!
323042000	My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.
323042001	
323042002	
323042003	
323042004	
323042005	
323042006	
323042007	
323042008	
323042009	
323042010	Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.
323042011	
323042012	
323042013	
323042014	
323042015	
323042016	
323042017	
323042018	
323042019	
323042020	Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.
323050000	Uur...urgh...
323050001	
323050002	
323050003	
323050004	
323050005	
323050006	
323050007	
323050008	
323050009	
323050010	A curse... A curse upon them all.
323050011	
323050012	
323050013	
323050014	
323050015	
323050016	
323050017	
323050018	
323050019	
323050020	They'll be born cursed, all of them.
323050021	
323050022	
323050023	
323050024	
323050025	
323050026	
323050027	
323050028	
323050029	
323050030	Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come…
323051000	Uur...urgh...
323051001	
323051002	
323051003	
323051004	
323051005	
323051006	
323051007	
323051008	
323051009	
323051010	Curse you, Golden Order.
323051011	
323051012	
323051013	
323051014	
323051015	
323051016	
323051017	
323051018	
323051019	
323051020	One day, you'll get what's coming.
323055000	Ah...argh...
323055001	
323055002	
323055003	
323055004	
323055005	
323055006	
323055007	
323055008	
323055009	
323055010	No... I am... the Dung Eater...
323055011	
323055012	
323055013	
323055014	
323055015	
323055016	
323055017	
323055018	
323055019	
323055020	I am...
323055021	
323055022	
323055023	
323055024	
323055025	
323055026	
323055027	
323055028	
323055029	
323055030	...
323056000	...
323060000	...
323800000	 
323800100	 
323800200	 
323900000	 
323900100	 
323900200	Bless you!
323900300	 
323900400	 
324001000	Oh, this is a rare occasion.
324001001	
324001002	
324001003	
324001004	
324001005	
324001006	
324001007	
324001008	
324001009	
324001010	I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.
324001011	
324001012	
324001013	
324001014	
324001015	
324001016	
324001017	
324001018	
324001019	
324001020	Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome.
324001021	
324001022	
324001023	
324001024	
324001025	
324001026	
324001027	
324001028	
324001029	
324001030	It is safe here. You may let down your guard.
324002000	Allow me a word of advice, as your senior.
324002001	
324002002	
324002003	
324002004	
324002005	
324002006	
324002007	
324002008	
324002009	
324002010	You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.
324002011	
324002012	
324002013	
324002014	
324002015	
324002016	
324002017	
324002018	
324002019	
324002020	A house guest, yet to earn their keep.
324002021	
324002022	
324002023	
324002024	
324002025	
324002026	
324002027	
324002028	
324002029	
324002030	Remember your place, newcomer.
324003000	There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.
324010000	What do you need? I have little time to spare.
324011000	Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?
324011001	
324011002	
324011003	
324011004	
324011005	
324011006	
324011007	
324011008	
324011009	
324011010	Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.
324011011	
324011012	
324011013	
324011014	
324011015	
324011016	
324011017	
324011018	
324011019	
324011020	Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.
324011021	
324011022	
324011023	
324011024	
324011025	
324011026	
324011027	
324011028	
324011029	
324011030	If those words held any meaning to you...
324011031	
324011032	
324011033	
324011034	
324011035	
324011036	
324011037	
324011038	
324011039	
324011040	Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.
324011041	
324011042	
324011043	
324011044	
324011045	
324011046	
324011047	
324011048	
324011049	
324011050	Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.
324011051	
324011052	
324011053	
324011054	
324011055	
324011056	
324011057	
324011058	
324011059	
324011060	And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
324012000	Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.
324012001	
324012002	
324012003	
324012004	
324012005	
324012006	
324012007	
324012008	
324012009	
324012010	As a true member of the Roundtable.
324012011	
324012012	
324012013	
324012014	
324012015	
324012016	
324012017	
324012018	
324012019	
324012020	I have high hopes for you.
324012021	
324012022	
324012023	
324012024	
324012025	
324012026	
324012027	
324012028	
324012029	
324012030	I'm sick and tired of them.
324012031	
324012032	
324012033	
324012034	
324012035	
324012036	
324012037	
324012038	
324012039	
324012040	These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...
324013000	We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to.
324015000	If you haven't anything to say, I would prefer you didn't pester me for attention.
324015001	
324015002	
324015003	
324015004	
324015005	
324015006	
324015007	
324015008	
324015009	
324015010	Try not to make a spectacle of yourself either. Or are you as irredeemably foolish as you appear?
324020000	You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?
324020001	
324020002	
324020003	
324020004	
324020005	
324020006	
324020007	
324020008	
324020009	
324020010	Then just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.
324020011	
324020012	
324020013	
324020014	
324020015	
324020016	
324020017	
324020018	
324020019	
324020020	I am known as Gideon Ofnir.
324020021	
324020022	
324020023	
324020024	
324020025	
324020026	
324020027	
324020028	
324020029	
324020030	As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,
324020031	
324020032	
324020033	
324020034	
324020035	
324020036	
324020037	
324020038	
324020039	
324020040	I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.
324020041	
324020042	
324020043	
324020044	
324020045	
324020046	
324020047	
324020048	
324020049	
324020050	You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.
324021000	You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh?
324021001	
324021002	
324021003	
324021004	
324021005	
324021006	
324021007	
324021008	
324021009	
324021010	Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge.
324021011	
324021012	
324021013	
324021014	
324021015	
324021016	
324021017	
324021018	
324021019	
324021020	The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers.
324021021	
324021022	
324021023	
324021024	
324021025	
324021026	
324021027	
324021028	
324021029	
324021030	We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.
324021031	
324021032	
324021033	
324021034	
324021035	
324021036	
324021037	
324021038	
324021039	
324021040	Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.
324021041	
324021042	
324021043	
324021044	
324021045	
324021046	
324021047	
324021048	
324021049	
324021050	General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.
324021051	
324021052	
324021053	
324021054	
324021055	
324021056	
324021057	
324021058	
324021059	
324021060	Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir.
324021061	
324021062	
324021063	
324021064	
324021065	
324021066	
324021067	
324021068	
324021069	
324021070	Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.
324021071	
324021072	
324021073	
324021074	
324021075	
324021076	
324021077	
324021078	
324021079	
324021080	And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.
324021081	
324021082	
324021083	
324021084	
324021085	
324021086	
324021087	
324021088	
324021089	
324021090	...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?
324022000	So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.
324022001	
324022002	
324022003	
324022004	
324022005	
324022006	
324022007	
324022008	
324022009	
324022010	Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.
324022011	
324022012	
324022013	
324022014	
324022015	
324022016	
324022017	
324022018	
324022019	
324022020	His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.
324022021	
324022022	
324022023	
324022024	
324022025	
324022026	
324022027	
324022028	
324022029	
324022030	...but I suspect you know that well enough already.
324023000	General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.
324023001	
324023002	
324023003	
324023004	
324023005	
324023006	
324023007	
324023008	
324023009	
324023010	He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.
324023011	
324023012	
324023013	
324023014	
324023015	
324023016	
324023017	
324023018	
324023019	
324023020	And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.
324023021	
324023022	
324023023	
324023024	
324023025	
324023026	
324023027	
324023028	
324023029	
324023030	I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.
324023031	
324023032	
324023033	
324023034	
324023035	
324023036	
324023037	
324023038	
324023039	
324023040	And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.
324023041	
324023042	
324023043	
324023044	
324023045	
324023046	
324023047	
324023048	
324023049	
324023050	Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...
324024000	Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.
324024001	
324024002	
324024003	
324024004	
324024005	
324024006	
324024007	
324024008	
324024009	
324024010	He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.
324024011	
324024012	
324024013	
324024014	
324024015	
324024016	
324024017	
324024018	
324024019	
324024020	The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree.
324024021	
324024022	
324024023	
324024024	
324024025	
324024026	
324024027	
324024028	
324024029	
324024030	It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.
324024031	
324024032	
324024033	
324024034	
324024035	
324024036	
324024037	
324024038	
324024039	
324024040	Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.
324025000	Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.
324025001	
324025002	
324025003	
324025004	
324025005	
324025006	
324025007	
324025008	
324025009	
324025010	It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.
324025011	
324025012	
324025013	
324025014	
324025015	
324025016	
324025017	
324025018	
324025019	
324025020	But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.
324025021	
324025022	
324025023	
324025024	
324025025	
324025026	
324025027	
324025028	
324025029	
324025030	Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.
324025031	
324025032	
324025033	
324025034	
324025035	
324025036	
324025037	
324025038	
324025039	
324025040	Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.
324026000	The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.
324026001	
324026002	
324026003	
324026004	
324026005	
324026006	
324026007	
324026008	
324026009	
324026010	Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.
324026011	
324026012	
324026013	
324026014	
324026015	
324026016	
324026017	
324026018	
324026019	
324026020	But Rennala herself is no demigod.
324026021	
324026022	
324026023	
324026024	
324026025	
324026026	
324026027	
324026028	
324026029	
324026030	She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon,
324026031	
324026032	
324026033	
324026034	
324026035	
324026036	
324026037	
324026038	
324026039	
324026040	Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.
324026041	
324026042	
324026043	
324026044	
324026045	
324026046	
324026047	
324026048	
324026049	
324026050	The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.
324027000	There are four more demigods yet to be located.
324027001	
324027002	
324027003	
324027004	
324027005	
324027006	
324027007	
324027008	
324027009	
324027010	Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed.
324027011	
324027012	
324027013	
324027014	
324027015	
324027016	
324027017	
324027018	
324027019	
324027020	His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.
324027021	
324027022	
324027023	
324027024	
324027025	
324027026	
324027027	
324027028	
324027029	
324027030	Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala.
324027031	
324027032	
324027033	
324027034	
324027035	
324027036	
324027037	
324027038	
324027039	
324027040	And the one only known as the Lord of Blood.
324027041	
324027042	
324027043	
324027044	
324027045	
324027046	
324027047	
324027048	
324027049	
324027050	Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune,
324027051	
324027052	
324027053	
324027054	
324027055	
324027056	
324027057	
324027058	
324027059	
324027060	so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.
324027061	
324027062	
324027063	
324027064	
324027065	
324027066	
324027067	
324027068	
324027069	
324027070	If you should learn anything of these matters,
324027071	
324027072	
324027073	
324027074	
324027075	
324027076	
324027077	
324027078	
324027079	
324027080	I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me.
324027081	
324027082	
324027083	
324027084	
324027085	
324027086	
324027087	
324027088	
324027089	
324027090	We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.
324027091	
324027092	
324027093	
324027094	
324027095	
324027096	
324027097	
324027098	
324027099	
324027100	As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.
324027580	I'll trade your findings for something rather special.
324030000	Ah, you. What is it?
324031000	Well...what is it now?
324032000	Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.
324032001	
324032002	
324032003	
324032004	
324032005	
324032006	
324032007	
324032008	
324032009	
324032010	Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.
324032011	
324032012	
324032013	
324032014	
324032015	
324032016	
324032017	
324032018	
324032019	
324032020	Make the journey.
324032021	
324032022	
324032023	
324032024	
324032025	
324032026	
324032027	
324032028	
324032029	
324032030	To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.
324032031	
324032032	
324032033	
324032034	
324032035	
324032036	
324032037	
324032038	
324032039	
324032040	The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.

324032045	
324032046	
324032047	
324032048	
324032049	
324032050	You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.
324032051	
324032052	
324032053	
324032054	
324032055	
324032056	
324032057	
324032058	
324032059	
324032060	For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.
324033000	Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.
324033001	
324033002	
324033003

324033017	
324033018	
324033019	
324033020	You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.
324035000	General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.
324035001	
324035002	
324035003	
324035004	
324035005	
324035006	
324035007	
324035008	
324035009	
324035010	He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.
324035011	
324035012	
324035013	
324035014	
324035015	
324035016	
324035017	
324035018	
324035019	
324035020	And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now.
324035021	
324035022	
324035023	
324035024	
324035025	
324035026	
324035027	
324035028	
324035029	
324035030	Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...
324036000	Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.
324036001	
324036002	
324036003	
324036004	
324036005	
324036006	
324036007	
324036008	
324036009	
324036010	It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.
324036011	
324036012	
324036013	
324036014	
324036015	
324036016	
324036017	
324036018	
324036019	
324036020	But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.
324036021	
324036022	
324036023	
324036024	
324036025	
324036026	
324036027	
324036028	
324036029	
324036030	Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.
324037000	The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.
324037001	
324037002	
324037003	
324037004	
324037005	
324037006	
324037007	
324037008	
324037009	
324037010	Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.
324037011	
324037012	
324037013	
324037014	
324037015	
324037016	
324037017	
324037018	
324037019	
324037020	And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches.
324038000	You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?
324038001	
324038002	
324038003	
324038004	
324038005	
324038006	
324038007	
324038008	
324038009	
324038010	Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.
324038011	
324038012	
324038013	
324038014	
324038015	
324038016	
324038017	
324038018	
324038019	
324038020	I am known as Gideon Ofnir.
324038021	
324038022	
324038023	
324038024	
324038025	
324038026	
324038027	
324038028	
324038029	
324038030	As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,
324038031	
324038032	
324038033	
324038034	
324038035	
324038036	
324038037	
324038038	
324038039	
324038040	I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.
324038041	
324038042	
324038043	
324038044	
324038045	
324038046	
324038047	
324038048	
324038049	
324038050	You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.
324040000	I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli.
324040001	
324040002	
324040003	
324040004	
324040005	
324040006	
324040007	
324040008	
324040009	
324040010	She is my daughter.
324040011	
324040012	
324040013	
324040014	
324040015	
324040016	
324040017	
324040018	
324040019	
324040020	I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace.
324040021	
324040022	
324040023	
324040024	
324040025	
324040026	
324040027	
324040028	
324040029	
324040030	Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.
324040031	
324040032	
324040033	
324040034	
324040035	
324040036	
324040037	
324040038	
324040039	
324040040	So I put her to work.
324040041	
324040042	
324040043	
324040044	
324040045	
324040046	
324040047	
324040048	
324040049	
324040050	Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.
324040051	
324040052	
324040053	
324040054	
324040055	
324040056	
324040057	
324040058	
324040059	
324040060	Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle.
324041000	Ahh, you've already heard?
324041001	
324041002	
324041003	
324041004	
324041005	
324041006	
324041007	
324041008	
324041009	
324041010	Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions.
324041011	
324041012	
324041013	
324041014	
324041015	
324041016	
324041017	
324041018	
324041019	
324041020	So I had no further use for her.
324041021	
324041022	
324041023	
324041024	
324041025	
324041026	
324041027	
324041028	
324041029	
324041030	Honestly, what's a man to do.
324041031	
324041032	
324041033	
324041034	
324041035	
324041036	
324041037	
324041038	
324041039	
324041040	A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.
324041041	
324041042	
324041043	
324041044	
324041045	
324041046	
324041047	
324041048	
324041049	
324041050	I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.
324041051	
324041052	
324041053	
324041054	
324041055	
324041056	
324041057	
324041058	
324041059	
324041060	A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.
324042000	Is that potion what I think it is?
324042001	
324042002	
324042003	
324042004	
324042005	
324042006	
324042007	
324042008	
324042009	
324042010	Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.
324042011	
324042012	
324042013	
324042014	
324042015	
324042016	
324042017	
324042018	
324042019	
324042020	Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must.
324042021	
324042022	
324042023	
324042024	
324042025	
324042026	
324042027	
324042028	
324042029	
324042030	The Roundtable has no code to speak of.
324042031	
324042032	
324042033	
324042034	
324042035	
324042036	
324042037	
324042038	
324042039	
324042040	But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?
324042041	
324042042	
324042043	
324042044	
324042045	
324042046	
324042047	
324042048	
324042049	
324042050	Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?
324043000	Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.
324043001	
324043002	
324043003	
324043004	
324043005	
324043006	
324043007	
324043008	
324043009	
324043010	You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.
324043011	
324043012	
324043013	
324043014	
324043015	
324043016	
324043017	
324043018	
324043019	
324043020	Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.
324043021	
324043022	
324043023	
324043024	
324043025	
324043026	
324043027	
324043028	
324043029	
324043030	Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.
324043031	
324043032	
324043033	
324043034	
324043035	
324043036	
324043037	
324043038	
324043039	
324043040	His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.
324044000	Well, I won't force you.
324044001	
324044002	
324044003	
324044004	
324044005	
324044006	
324044007	
324044008	
324044009	
324044010	But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.
324044011	
324044012	
324044013	
324044014	
324044015	
324044016	
324044017	
324044018	
324044019	
324044020	She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.
324044021	
324044022	
324044023	
324044024	
324044025	
324044026	
324044027	
324044028	
324044029	
324044030	Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.
324045000	I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.
324045001	
324045002	
324045003	
324045004	
324045005	
324045006	
324045007	
324045008	
324045009	
324045010	Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.
324045011	
324045012	
324045013	
324045014	
324045015	
324045016	
324045017	
324045018	
324045019	
324045020	Sorry. For the time you had to waste.
324046000	Well, I won't force you.
324046001	
324046002	
324046003	
324046004	
324046005	
324046006	
324046007	
324046008	
324046009	
324046010	If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you.
324046011	
324046012	
324046013	
324046014	
324046015	
324046016	
324046017	
324046018	
324046019	
324046020	Not that I could fathom why you'd want to...
324050000	Oh, my apologies for that nasty business.
324050001	
324050002	
324050003	
324050004	
324050005	
324050006	
324050007	
324050008	
324050009	
324050010	Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems.
324050011	
324050012	
324050013	
324050014	
324050015	
324050016	
324050017	
324050018	
324050019	
324050020	As his master, I'd like to express my regret.
324050021	
324050022	
324050023	
324050024	
324050025	
324050026	
324050027	
324050028	
324050029	
324050030	But now, Ensha is slain and gone.

324050039	
324050040	Finished, forever more.
324051000	Ah, yes, by way of apology,

324053023	
324053024	
324053025	
324053026	
324053027	
324053028	
324053029	
324053030	It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.
324053031	
324053032	
324053033	
324053034	
324053035	
324053036	
324053037	
324053038	
324053039	
324053040	And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.
324054000	Find the village of the Albinaurics.
324054001	
324054002	
324054003	
324054004	
324054005	
324054006	
324054007	
324054008	
324054009	
324054010	It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.
324054011	
324054012	
324054013	
324054014	
324054015	
324054016	
324054017	
324054018	
324054019	
324054020	Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. 
324060000	Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you.
324060001	
324060002	
324060003	
324060004	
324060005	
324060006	
324060007	
324060008	
324060009	
324060010	To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
324060011	
324060012	
324060013	
324060014	
324060015	
324060016	
324060017	
324060018	
324060019	
324060020	Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.
324060021	
324060022	
324060023	
324060024	
324060025	
324060026	
324060027	
324060028	
324060029	
324060030	Hah, no need to pay me for that gift.
324060031	
324060032	
324060033	
324060034	
324060035	
324060036	
324060037	
324060038	
324060039	
324060040	All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance.
324060041	
324060042	
324060043	
324060044	
324060045	
324060046	
324060047	
324060048	
324060049	
324060050	That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.
324060051	
324060052	
324060053	
324060054	
324060055	
324060056	
324060057	
324060058	
324060059	
324060060	It doesn't have to be me, my fellow.
324061000	If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
324061001	
324061002	
324061003	
324061004	
324061005	
324061006	
324061007	
324061008	
324061009	
324061010	You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.
324061011	
324061012	
324061013	
324061014	
324061015	
324061016	
324061017	
324061018	
324061019	
324061020	I marked your map with its location.
324061021	
324061022	
324061023	
324061024	
324061025	
324061026	
324061027	
324061028	
324061029	
324061030	Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".
324061031	
324061032	
324061033	
324061034	
324061035	
324061036	
324061037	
324061038	
324061039	
324061040	The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.
324070000	Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.
324070001	
324070002	
324070003	
324070004	
324070005	
324070006	
324070007	
324070008	
324070009	
324070010	I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.
324070011	
324070012	
324070013	
324070014	
324070015	
324070016	
324070017	
324070018	
324070019	
324070020	You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...
324070021	
324070022	
324070023	
324070024	
324070025	
324070026	
324070027	
324070028	
324070029	
324070030	Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.
324070031	
324070032	
324070033	
324070034	
324070035	
324070036	
324070037	
324070038	
324070039	
324070040	I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?
324070041	
324070042	
324070043	
324070044	
324070045	
324070046	
324070047	
324070048	
324070049	
324070050	Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.
324071000	Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree?
324071001	
324071002	
324071003	
324071004	
324071005	
324071006	
324071007	
324071008	
324071009	
324071010	I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.
324071011	
324071012	
324071013	
324071014	
324071015	
324071016	
324071017	
324071018	
324071019	
324071020	Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.
324071021	
324071022	
324071023	
324071024	
324071025	
324071026	
324071027	
324071028	
324071029	
324071030	But...with the Haligtree as it is...
324071031	
324071032	
324071033	
324071034	
324071035	
324071036	
324071037	
324071038	
324071039	
324071040	I suppose Miquella must already be...
324072000	Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.
324072001	
324072002	
324072003	
324072004	
324072005	
324072006	
324072007	
324072008	
324072009	
324072010	The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:
324072011	
324072012	
324072013	
324072014	
324072015	
324072016	
324072017	
324072018	
324072019	
324072020	A hidden treasure, known only to me.
324072021	
324072022	
324072023	
324072024	
324072025	
324072026	
324072027	
324072028	
324072029	
324072030	A secret rite known only to me.
324072031	
324072032	
324072033	
324072034	
324072035	
324072036	
324072037	
324072038	
324072039	
324072040	You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.
324072530	And it is a wondrous thing indeed.
324073000	So. The Haligtree, now but a husk...
324073001	
324073002	
324073003	
324073004	
324073005	
324073006	
324073007	
324073008	
324073009	
324073010	I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,
324073011	
324073012	
324073013	
324073014	
324073015	
324073016	
324073017	
324073018	
324073019	
324073020	but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.
324073021	
324073022	
324073023	
324073024	
324073025	
324073026	
324073027	
324073028	
324073029	
324073030	Indeed, it seems those words held weight.
324073031	
324073032	
324073033	
324073034	
324073035	
324073036	
324073037	
324073038	
324073039	
324073040	How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...
324073041	
324073042	
324073043	
324073044	
324073045	
324073046	
324073047	
324073048	
324073049	
324073050	Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...
324074000	Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.
324074001	
324074002	
324074003	
324074004	
324074005	
324074006	
324074007	
324074008	
324074009	
324074010	A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty,\nwhile he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.
324074011	
324074012	
324074013	
324074014	
324074015	
324074016	
324074017	
324074018	
324074019	
324074020	Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.
324074021	
324074022	
324074023	
324074024	
324074025	
324074026	
324074027	
324074028	
324074029	
324074030	But perhaps it's worth looking into...
324074031	
324074032	
324074033	
324074034	
324074035	
324074036	
324074037	
324074038	
324074039	
324074040	If what I've heard is right, then maybe...
324075000	Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!
324075001	
324075002	
324075003	
324075004	
324075005	
324075006	
324075007	
324075008	
324075009	
324075010	That is some fine intelligence indeed!
324075011	
324075012	
324075013	
324075014	
324075015	
324075016	
324075017	
324075018	
324075019	
324075020	With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.
324075021	
324075022	
324075023	
324075024	
324075025	
324075026	
324075027	
324075028	
324075029	
324075030	One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.
324075031	
324075032	
324075033	
324075034	
324075035	
324075036	
324075037	
324075038	
324075039	
324075040	As promised, allow me to impart to you
324075041	
324075042	
324075043	
324075044	
324075045	
324075046	
324075047	
324075048	
324075049	
324075050	the last of the hidden treasures known only to me.
324075051	
324075052	
324075053	
324075054	
324075055	
324075056	
324075057	
324075058	
324075059	
324075060	the last of the secret rites known only to me.
324075061	
324075062	
324075063	
324075064	
324075065	
324075066	
324075067	
324075068	
324075069	
324075070	a thing most wondrous, known only to me.
324076000	Well, I wonder what comes next...
324076001	
324076002	
324076003	
324076004	
324076005	
324076006	
324076007	
324076008	
324076009	
324076010	If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.
324076011	
324076012	
324076013	
324076014	
324076015	
324076016	
324076017	
324076018	
324076019	
324076020	But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.
324076021	
324076022	
324076023	
324076024	
324076025	
324076026	
324076027	
324076028	
324076029	
324076030	Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...
324077000	You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?
324077001	
324077002	
324077003	
324077004	
324077005	
324077006	
324077007	
324077008	
324077009	
324077010	Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.
324077011	
324077012	
324077013	
324077014	
324077015	
324077016	
324077017	
324077018	
324077019	
324077020	Ah, no need to fret about that.
324077021	
324077022	
324077023	
324077024	
324077025	
324077026	
324077027	
324077028	
324077029	
324077030	The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.
324077031	
324077032	
324077033	
324077034	
324077035	
324077036	
324077037	
324077038	
324077039	
324077040	And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,
324077041	
324077042	
324077043	
324077044	
324077045	
324077046	
324077047	
324077048	
324077049	
324077050	then the Roundtable must go, as well.
324078000	I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.
324078001	
324078002	
324078003	
324078004	
324078005	
324078006	
324078007	
324078008	
324078009	
324078010	I must learn all that can be taken from this place,
324078011	
324078012	
324078013	
324078014	
324078015	
324078016	
324078017	
324078018	
324078019	
324078020	and sear it into my memory.
324078021	
324078022	
324078023	
324078024	
324078025	
324078026	
324078027	
324078028	
324078029	
324078030	How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less?
324079000	The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.
324079001	
324079002	
324079003	
324079004	
324079005	
324079006	
324079007	
324079008	
324079009	
324079010	Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.
324079011	
324079012	
324079013	
324079014	
324079015	
324079016	
324079017	
324079018	
324079019	
324079020	Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.
324079021	
324079022	
324079023	
324079024	
324079025	
324079026	
324079027	
324079028	
324079029	
324079030	Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?
324079031	
324079032	
324079033	
324079034	
324079035	
324079036	
324079037	
324079038	
324079039	
324079040	What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?
324080000	Ahh, I knew you'd come.
324080001	
324080002	
324080003	
324080004	
324080005	
324080006	
324080007	
324080008	
324080009	
324080010	To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.
324080011	
324080012	
324080013	
324080014	
324080015	
324080016	
324080017	
324080018	
324080019	
324080020	What a sad state of affairs.
324080021	
324080022	
324080023	
324080024	
324080025	
324080026	
324080027	
324080028	
324080029	
324080030	I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.
324080031	
324080032	
324080033	
324080034	
324080035	
324080036	
324080037	
324080038	
324080039	
324080040	Queen Marika has high hopes for us.
324080041	
324080042	
324080043	
324080044	
324080045	
324080046	
324080047	
324080048	
324080049	
324080050	That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.
324100000	You think I don't know what that is?
324100001	
324100002	
324100003	
324100004	
324100005	
324100006	
324100007	
324100008	
324100009	
324100010	I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at.
324100011	
324100012	
324100013	
324100014	
324100015	
324100016	
324100017	
324100018	
324100019	
324100020	You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.
324800000	My fellow, you've fought well, until now.
324801000	I know...in my bones...
324801001	
324801002	
324801003	
324801004	
324801005	
324801006	
324801007	
324801008	
324801009	
324801010	A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.
324801011	
324801012	
324801013	
324801014	
324801015	
324801016	
324801017	
324801018	
324801019	
324801020	A man cannot kill a god...
324900000	 
324900100	Knowledge above all!
324900200	 
324900300	 
325001000	Ah, nice to meet you.
325001001	
325001002	
325001003	
325001004	
325001005	
325001006	
325001007	
325001008	
325001009	
325001010	The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.
325001011	
325001012	
325001013	
325001014	
325001015	
325001016	
325001017	
325001018	
325001019	
325001020	I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.
325001021	
325001022	
325001023	
325001024	
325001025	
325001026	
325001027	
325001028	
325001029	
325001030	When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.
325001031	
325001032	
325001033	
325001034	
325001035	
325001036	
325001037	
325001038	
325001039	
325001040	But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?
325001041	
325001042	
325001043	
325001044	
325001045	
325001046	
325001047	
325001048	
325001049	
325001050	This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.
325001051	
325001052	
325001053	
325001054	
325001055	
325001056	
325001057	
325001058	
325001059	
325001060	Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...
325002000	I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?
325002001	
325002002	
325002003	
325002004	
325002005	
325002006	
325002007	
325002008	
325002009	
325002010	You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.
325002011	
325002012	
325002013	
325002014	
325002015	
325002016	
325002017	
325002018	
325002019	
325002020	Well, enjoy it while you can.
325002021	
325002022	
325002023	
325002024	
325002025	
325002026	
325002027	
325002028	
325002029	
325002030	I'm Tarnished, like you.
325002031	
325002032	
325002033	
325002034	
325002035	
325002036	
325002037	
325002038	
325002039	
325002040	But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.
325002041	
325002042	
325002043	
325002044	
325002045	
325002046	
325002047	
325002048	
325002049	
325002050	Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.
325002051	
325002052	
325002053	
325002054	
325002055	
325002056	
325002057	
325002058	
325002059	
325002060	I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
325002061	
325002062	
325002063	
325002064	
325002065	
325002066	
325002067	
325002068	
325002069	
325002070	Would you care to learn one?
325002071	
325002072	
325002073	
325002074	
325002075	
325002076	
325002077	
325002078	
325002079	
325002080	As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please.
325003000	Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we?
325004000	Oh hello there, good to see you safe.
325004001	
325004002	
325004003	
325004004	
325004005	
325004006	
325004007	
325004008	
325004009	
325004010	Stopping by to learn a battle art or two?
325005000	The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.
325005001	
325005002	
325005003	
325005004	
325005005	
325005006	
325005007	
325005008	
325005009	
325005010	They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.
325005011	
325005012	
325005013	
325005014	
325005015	
325005016	
325005017	
325005018	
325005019	
325005020	In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.
325005021	
325005022	
325005023	
325005024	
325005025	
325005026	
325005027	
325005028	
325005029	
325005030	Fascinating, isn't it?
325005031	
325005032	
325005033	
325005034	
325005035	
325005036	
325005037	
325005038	
325005039	
325005040	That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.
325005041	
325005042	
325005043	
325005044	
325005045	
325005046	
325005047	
325005048	
325005049	
325005050	With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,
325005051	
325005052	
325005053	
325005054	
325005055	
325005056	
325005057	
325005058	
325005059	
325005060	such adaptability is more important now than ever.
325006000	Of course. I understand.
325006001	
325006002	
325006003	
325006004	
325006005	
325006006	
325006007	
325006008	
325006009	
325006010	Why place trust in a perfect stranger?
325006011	
325006012	
325006013	
325006014	
325006015	
325006016	
325006017	
325006018	
325006019	
325006020	Be safe, then, stranger.
325006021	
325006022	
325006023	
325006024	
325006025	
325006026	
325006027	
325006028	
325006029	
325006030	Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same.
325007000	Oh? Something bothering you?
325007001	
325007002	
325007003	
325007004	
325007005	
325007006	
325007007	
325007008	
325007009	
325007010	Or are you just trying to pass the time?
325007011	
325007012	
325007013	
325007014	
325007015	
325007016	
325007017	
325007018	
325007019	
325007020	I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle.
325020000	Ah, we meet again after all.
325020001	
325020002	
325020003	
325020004	
325020005	
325020006	
325020007	
325020008	
325020009	
325020010	I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.
325020011	
325020012	
325020013	
325020014	
325020015	
325020016	
325020017	
325020018	
325020019	
325020020	So. What do you need?
325021000	Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.
325021001	
325021002	
325021003	
325021004	
325021005	
325021006	
325021007	
325021008	
325021009	
325021010	Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.
325021011	
325021012	
325021013	
325021014	
325021015	
325021016	
325021017	
325021018	
325021019	
325021020	Well done, friend.
325021021	
325021022	
325021023	
325021024	
325021025	
325021026	
325021027	
325021028	
325021029	
325021030	Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.
325021031	
325021032	
325021033	
325021034	
325021035	
325021036	
325021037	
325021038	
325021039	
325021040	As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.
325021041	
325021042	
325021043	
325021044	
325021045	
325021046	
325021047	
325021048	
325021049	
325021050	No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.
325022000	The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?
325022001	
325022002	
325022003	
325022004	
325022005	
325022006	
325022007	
325022008	
325022009	
325022010	That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.
325022011	
325022012	
325022013	
325022014	
325022015	
325022016	
325022017	
325022018	
325022019	
325022020	It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.
325022021	
325022022	
325022023	
325022024	
325022025	
325022026	
325022027	
325022028	
325022029	
325022030	Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.
325022031	
325022032	
325022033	
325022034	
325022035	
325022036	
325022037	
325022038	
325022039	
325022040	And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.
325022041	
325022042	
325022043	
325022044	
325022045	
325022046	
325022047	
325022048	
325022049	
325022050	That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.
325022051	
325022052	
325022053	
325022054	
325022055	
325022056	
325022057	
325022058	
325022059	
325022060	And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.
325022061	
325022062	
325022063	
325022064	
325022065	
325022066	
325022067	
325022068	
325022069	
325022070	I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.
325022071	
325022072	
325022073	
325022074	
325022075	
325022076	
325022077	
325022078	
325022079	
325022080	The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,
325022081	
325022082	
325022083	
325022084	
325022085	
325022086	
325022087	
325022088	
325022089	
325022090	You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?
325023000	This...is a black knifeprint!
325023001	
325023002	
325023003	
325023004	
325023005	
325023006	
325023007	
325023008	
325023009	
325023010	I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!
325023011	
325023012	
325023013	
325023014	
325023015	
325023016	
325023017	
325023018	
325023019	
325023020	You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?
325023021	
325023022	
325023023	
325023024	
325023025	
325023026	
325023027	
325023028	
325023029	
325023030	They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.
325023031	
325023032	
325023033	
325023034	
325023035	
325023036	
325023037	
325023038	
325023039	
325023040	A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.
325023041	
325023042	
325023043	
325023044	
325023045	
325023046	
325023047	
325023048	
325023049	
325023050	The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.
325023051	
325023052	
325023053	
325023054	
325023055	
325023056	
325023057	
325023058	
325023059	
325023060	Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.
325023061	
325023062	
325023063	
325023064	
325023065	
325023066	
325023067	
325023068	
325023069	
325023070	I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.
325023071	
325023072	
325023073	
325023074	
325023075	
325023076	
325023077	
325023078	
325023079	
325023080	Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.
325023081	
325023082	
325023083	
325023084	
325023085	
325023086	
325023087	
325023088	
325023089	
325023090	Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...
325023091	
325023092	
325023093	
325023094	
325023095	
325023096	
325023097	
325023098	
325023099	
325023100	Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.
325024000	Oh, still need something?
325026000	Always good to see you safe.
325026001	
325026002	
325026003	
325026004	
325026005	
325026006	
325026007	
325026008	
325026009	
325026010	So. What do you need?
325027000	Ah, so you've met D.
325027001	
325027002	
325027003	
325027004	
325027005	
325027006	
325027007	
325027008	
325027009	
325027010	D is an old friend.
325027011	
325027012	
325027013	
325027014	
325027015	
325027016	
325027017	
325027018	
325027019	
325027020	We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.
325027021	
325027022	
325027023	
325027024	
325027025	
325027026	
325027027	
325027028	
325027029	
325027030	But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.
325027031	
325027032	
325027033	
325027034	
325027035	
325027036	
325027037	
325027038	
325027039	
325027040	Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.
325028000	Pleased to meet you.
325028001	
325028002	
325028003	
325028004	
325028005	
325028006	
325028007	
325028008	
325028009	
325028010	The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.
325028011	
325028012	
325028013	
325028014	
325028015	
325028016	
325028017	
325028018	
325028019	
325028020	But now I'm in this sorry state.
325028021	
325028022	
325028023	
325028024	
325028025	
325028026	
325028027	
325028028	
325028029	
325028030	I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.
325028031	
325028032	
325028033	
325028034	
325028035	
325028036	
325028037	
325028038	
325028039	
325028040	As you might guess, it's far from ideal...
325029000	Ah, I know.
325029001	
325029002	
325029003	
325029004	
325029005	
325029006	
325029007	
325029008	
325029009	
325029010	I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
325029011	
325029012	
325029013	
325029014	
325029015	
325029016	
325029017	
325029018	
325029019	
325029020	Would you care to learn one?
325029021	
325029022	
325029023	
325029024	
325029025	
325029026	
325029027	
325029028	
325029029	
325029030	Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.
325029031	
325029032	
325029033	
325029034	
325029035	
325029036	
325029037	
325029038	
325029039	
325029040	A little conversation goes a long way.
325030000	Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.
325030001	
325030002	
325030003	
325030004	
325030005	
325030006	
325030007	
325030008	
325030009	
325030010	My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.
325030011	
325030012	
325030013	
325030014	
325030015	
325030016	
325030017	
325030018	
325030019	
325030020	Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.
325030021	
325030022	
325030023	
325030024	
325030025	
325030026	
325030027	
325030028	
325030029	
325030030	Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala.
325030031	
325030032	
325030033	
325030034	
325030035	
325030036	
325030037	
325030038	
325030039	
325030040	Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.
325030041	
325030042	
325030043	
325030044	
325030045	
325030046	
325030047	
325030048	
325030049	
325030050	Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.
325030051	
325030052	
325030053	
325030054	
325030055	
325030056	
325030057	
325030058	
325030059	
325030060	Truly, you have my thanks.
325030061	
325030062	
325030063	
325030064	
325030065	
325030066	
325030067	
325030068	
325030069	
325030070	But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.
325030071	
325030072	
325030073	
325030074	
325030075	
325030076	
325030077	
325030078	
325030079	
325030080	If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,
325030081	
325030082	
325030083	
325030084	
325030085	
325030086	
325030087	
325030088	
325030089	
325030090	then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.
325030091	
325030092	
325030093	
325030094	
325030095	
325030096	
325030097	
325030098	
325030099	
325030100	I would like you to procure it for me.
325030101	
325030102	
325030103	
325030104	
325030105	
325030106	
325030107	
325030108	
325030109	
325030110	And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.
325030111	
325030112	
325030113	
325030114	
325030115	
325030116	
325030117	
325030118	
325030119	
325030120	Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace.
325030121	
325030122	
325030123	
325030124	
325030125	
325030126	
325030127	
325030128	
325030129	
325030130	If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,
325030131	
325030132	
325030133	
325030134	
325030135	
325030136	
325030137	
325030138	
325030139	
325030140	The answers you find will surely bolster your chances.
325031000	I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.
325031001	
325031002	
325031003	
325031004	
325031005	
325031006	
325031007	
325031008	
325031009	
325031010	There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
325031011	
325031012	
325031013	
325031014	
325031015	
325031016	
325031017	
325031018	
325031019	
325031020	It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.
325031021	
325031022	
325031023	
325031024	
325031025	
325031026	
325031027	
325031028	
325031029	
325031030	There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years
325031031	
325031032	
325031033	
325031034	
325031035	
325031036	
325031037	
325031038	
325031039	
325031040	Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.
325031041	
325031042	
325031043	
325031044	
325031045	
325031046	
325031047	
325031048	
325031049	
325031050	But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...
325032000	If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,
325032001	
325032002	
325032003	
325032004	
325032005	
325032006	
325032007	
325032008	
325032009	
325032010	then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.
325032011	
325032012	
325032013	
325032014	
325032015	
325032016	
325032017	
325032018	
325032019	
325032020	Would you be willing to procure it for me?
325032021	
325032022	
325032023	
325032024	
325032025	
325032026	
325032027	
325032028	
325032029	
325032030	She may have returned to the manor that is her home.
325032031	
325032032	
325032033	
325032034	
325032035	
325032036	
325032037	
325032038	
325032039	
325032040	The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
325033000	I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.
325033001	
325033002	
325033003	
325033004	
325033005	
325033006	
325033007	
325033008	
325033009	
325033010	Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?
325033011	
325033012	
325033013	
325033014	
325033015	
325033016	
325033017	
325033018	
325033019	
325033020	The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.
325033021	
325033022	
325033023	
325033024	
325033025	
325033026	
325033027	
325033028	
325033029	
325033030	By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.
325033031	
325033032	
325033033	
325033034	
325033035	
325033036	
325033037	
325033038	
325033039	
325033040	But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.
325033041	
325033042	
325033043	
325033044	
325033045	
325033046	
325033047	
325033048	
325033049	
325033050	You may find this peculiar,
325033051	
325033052	
325033053	
325033054	
325033055	
325033056	
325033057	
325033058	
325033059	
325033060	but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.
325033061	
325033062	
325033063	
325033064	
325033065	
325033066	
325033067	
325033068	
325033069	
325033070	These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.
325034000	Yes, indeed.
325034001	
325034002	
325034003	
325034004	
325034005	
325034006	
325034007	
325034008	
325034009	
325034010	If D knew what drives me now,
325034011	
325034012	
325034013	
325034014	
325034015	
325034016	
325034017	
325034018	
325034019	
325034020	he would surely boil over with rage.
325034021	
325034022	
325034023	
325034024	
325034025	
325034026	
325034027	
325034028	
325034029	
325034030	Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.
325034031	
325034032	
325034033	
325034034	
325034035	
325034036	
325034037	
325034038	
325034039	
325034040	But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.
325034041	
325034042	
325034043	
325034044	
325034045	
325034046	
325034047	
325034048	
325034049	
325034050	I can tell a good lie when I need to.
325035000	And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...
325035001	
325035002	
325035003	
325035004	
325035005	
325035006	
325035007	
325035008	
325035009	
325035010	I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...
325036000	Oh? Forgot something, did you?
325037000	Alright there. Good to see you safe.
325040000	I see...
325040001	
325040002	
325040003	
325040004	
325040005	
325040006	
325040007	
325040008	
325040009	
325040010	When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.
325040011	
325040012	
325040013	
325040014	
325040015	
325040016	
325040017	
325040018	
325040019	
325040020	You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...
325040021	
325040022	
325040023	
325040024	
325040025	
325040026	
325040027	
325040028	
325040029	
325040030	But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...
325040031	
325040032	
325040033	
325040034	
325040035	
325040036	
325040037	
325040038	
325040039	
325040040	Then perhaps it's true after all.
325040041	
325040042	
325040043	
325040044	
325040045	
325040046	
325040047	
325040048	
325040049	
325040050	Hmm.
325040051	
325040052	
325040053	
325040054	
325040055	
325040056	
325040057	
325040058	
325040059	
325040060	Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...
325040061	
325040062	
325040063	
325040064	
325040065	
325040066	
325040067	
325040068	
325040069	
325040070	How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?
325040071	
325040072	
325040073	
325040074	
325040075	
325040076	
325040077	
325040078	
325040079	
325040080	Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.
325040081	
325040082	
325040083	
325040084	
325040085	
325040086	
325040087	
325040088	
325040089	
325040090	The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.
325040091	
325040092	
325040093	
325040094	
325040095	
325040096	
325040097	
325040098	
325040099	
325040100	And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.
325040101	
325040102	
325040103	
325040104	
325040105	
325040106	
325040107	
325040108	
325040109	
325040110	I know you've got what it takes.
325040111	
325040112	
325040113	
325040114	
325040115	
325040116	
325040117	
325040118	
325040119	
325040120	Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.
325041000	Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?
325041001	
325041002	
325041003	
325041004	
325041005	
325041006	
325041007	
325041008	
325041009	
325041010	While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.
325041011	
325041012	
325041013	
325041014	
325041015	
325041016	
325041017	
325041018	
325041019	
325041020	And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.
325041021	
325041022	
325041023	
325041024	
325041025	
325041026	
325041027	
325041028	
325041029	
325041030	I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.
325041031	
325041032	
325041033	
325041034	
325041035	
325041036	
325041037	
325041038	
325041039	
325041040	But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.
325041041	
325041042	
325041043	
325041044	
325041045	
325041046	
325041047	
325041048	
325041049	
325041050	Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.
325045000	D was telling me.
325045001	
325045002	
325045003	
325045004	
325045005	
325045006	
325045007	
325045008	
325045009	
325045010	That he discovered the mark of the centipede.
325045011	
325045012	
325045013	
325045014	
325045015	
325045016	
325045017	
325045018	
325045019	
325045020	The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.
325045021	
325045022	
325045023	
325045024	
325045025	
325045026	
325045027	
325045028	
325045029	
325045030	As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,
325045031	
325045032	
325045033	
325045034	
325045035	
325045036	
325045037	
325045038	
325045039	
325045040	then we may be able to form an alliance.
325045041	
325045042	
325045043	
325045044	
325045045	
325045046	
325045047	
325045048	
325045049	
325045050	If only I could speak to them in person.
325045051	
325045052	
325045053	
325045054	
325045055	
325045056	
325045057	
325045058	
325045059	
325045060	And if they were like you, all the better.
325046000	Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.
325046001	
325046002	
325046003	
325046004	
325046005	
325046006	
325046007	
325046008	
325046009	
325046010	Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...
325046011	
325046012	
325046013	
325046014	
325046015	
325046016	
325046017	
325046018	
325046019	
325046020	Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.
325046021	
325046022	
325046023	
325046024	
325046025	
325046026	
325046027	
325046028	
325046029	
325046030	And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.
325046031	
325046032	
325046033	
325046034	
325046035	
325046036	
325046037	
325046038	
325046039	
325046040	So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.
325046041	
325046042	
325046043	
325046044	
325046045	
325046046	
325046047	
325046048	
325046049	
325046050	Since you're so scary and all.

326001005

326001007	
326001008	
326001009	
326001010	Name's Bernahl. Tarnished, just like you.
326001011	
326001012	
326001013	
326001014	
326001015	
326001016	
326001017	
326001018	
326001019	
326001020	Let me ask you something.
326001021	
326001022	
326001023	
326001024	
326001025	
326001026	
326001027	
326001028	
326001029	
326001030	Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight?
326001031	
326001032	
326001033	
326001034	
326001035	
326001036	
326001037	
326001038	
326001039	
326001040	Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm,
326001041	
326001042	
326001043	
326001044	
326001045	
326001046	
326001047	
326001048	
326001049	
326001050	despite the collapse of the Golden Order?
326002000	Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through.
326002001	
326002002	
326002003	
326002004	
326002005	
326002006	
326002007	
326002008	
326002009	
326002010	Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever.
326002011	
326002012	
326002013	
326002014	
326002015	
326002016	
326002017	
326002018	
326002019	
326002020	Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?
326002021	
326002022	
326002023	
326002024	
326002025	
326002026	
326002027	
326002028	
326002029	
326002030	All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.
326002031	
326002032	
326002033	
326002034	
326002035	
326002036	
326002037	
326002038	
326002039	
326002040	Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.
326003000	Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.
326004000	Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe.
326004001	
326004002	
326004003	
326004004	
326004005	
326004006	
326004007	
326004008	
326004009	
326004010	Here to learn a battle art or two?
326005000	There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover.
326005001	
326005002	
326005003	
326005004	
326005005	
326005006	
326005007	
326005008	
326005009	
326005010	Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died.
326005011	
326005012	
326005013	
326005014	
326005015	
326005016	
326005017	
326005018	
326005019	
326005020	A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance.
326005021	
326005022	
326005023	
326005024	
326005025	
326005026	
326005027	
326005028	
326005029	
326005030	That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat.
326005031	
326005032	
326005033	
326005034	
326005035	
326005036	
326005037	
326005038	
326005039	
326005040	It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.
326006000	Honest to a fault, I see.
326006001	
326006002	
326006003	
326006004	
326006005	
326006006	
326006007	
326006008	
326006009	
326006010	Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished.
326006011	
326006012	
326006013	
326006014	
326006015	
326006016	
326006017	
326006018	
326006019	
326006020	But there's nothing wrong with that.
326006021	
326006022	
326006023	
326006024	
326006025	
326006026	
326006027	
326006028	
326006029	
326006030	Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?
326006031	
326006032	
326006033	
326006034	
326006035	
326006036	
326006037	
326006038	
326006039	
326006040	All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.
326006041	
326006042	
326006043	
326006044	
326006045	
326006046	
326006047	
326006048	
326006049	
326006050	Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you.
326007000	Not floating your boat, eh?
326007001	
326007002	
326007003	
326007004	
326007005	
326007006	
326007007	
326007008	
326007009	
326007010	Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.
326008000	There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts?
326009000	Well, until we meet again.
326010000	You...
326010001	
326010002	
326010003	
326010004	
326010005	
326010006	
326010007	
326010008	
326010009	
326010010	What in heaven's name are you doing here?
326010011	
326010012	
326010013	
326010014	
326010015	
326010016	
326010017	
326010018	
326010019	
326010020	The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.
326010021	
326010022	
326010023	
326010024	
326010025	
326010026	
326010027	
326010028	
326010029	
326010030	I hope you understand the weight of my words.
326011000	Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
326011001	
326011002	
326011003	
326011004	
326011005	
326011006	
326011007	
326011008	
326011009	
326011010	I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue.
326011011	
326011012	
326011013	
326011014	
326011015	
326011016	
326011017	
326011018	
326011019	
326011020	Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.
326011021	
326011022	
326011023	
326011024	
326011025	
326011026	
326011027	
326011028	
326011029	
326011030	But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
326011031	
326011032	
326011033	
326011034	
326011035	
326011036	
326011037	
326011038	
326011039	
326011040	Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
326012000	This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death.
326012001	
326012002	
326012003	
326012004	
326012005	
326012006	
326012007	
326012008	
326012009	
326012010	Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
326013000	So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt.
326013001	
326013002	
326013003	
326013004	
326013005	
326013006	
326013007	
326013008	
326013009	
326013010	Then I shall introduce myself once more.
326013011	
326013012	
326013013	
326013014	
326013015	
326013016	
326013017	
326013018	
326013019	
326013020	Bernahl, a recusant, just like you.
326013021	
326013022	
326013023	
326013024	
326013025	
326013026	
326013027	
326013028	
326013029	
326013030	Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.
326013031	
326013032	
326013033	
326013034	
326013035	
326013036	
326013037	
326013038	
326013039	
326013040	Why not add some to your repertoire?
326014000	Oh, not had your fill, eh?
326015000	You're still alive, I see.
326015001	
326015002	
326015003	
326015004	
326015005	
326015006	
326015007	
326015008	
326015009	
326015010	Why not learn another battle art, see if we can't keep it that way.
326016000	You've come to understand, now, eh?
326016001	
326016002	
326016003	
326016004	
326016005	
326016006	
326016007	
326016008	
326016009	
326016010	To take power and make it his own,
326016011	
326016012	
326016013	
326016014	
326016015	
326016016	
326016017	
326016018	
326016019	
326016020	The recusant must hunt his own kind.
326016021	
326016022	
326016023	
326016024	
326016025	
326016026	
326016027	
326016028	
326016029	
326016030	To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging,
326016031	
326016032	
326016033	
326016034	
326016035	
326016036	
326016037	
326016038	
326016039	
326016040	We recusants must become the most wretched of predators.
326016041	
326016042	
326016043	
326016044	
326016045	
326016046	
326016047	
326016048	
326016049	
326016050	All you can do is laugh.
326017000	Look at you. A recusant through and through.
326017001	
326017002	
326017003	
326017004	
326017005	
326017006	
326017007	
326017008	
326017009	
326017010	I knew you had it in you.
326017011	
326017012	
326017013	
326017014	
326017015	
326017016	
326017017	
326017018	
326017019	
326017020	Take this.
326017021	
326017022	
326017023	
326017024	
326017025	
326017026	
326017027	
326017028	
326017029	
326017030	A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.
326017031	
326017032	
326017033	
326017034	
326017035	
326017036	
326017037	
326017038	
326017039	
326017040	If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.
326018000	Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return.
326018001	
326018002	
326018003	
326018004	
326018005	
326018006	
326018007	
326018008	
326018009	
326018010	I have the reward from Lady Tanith.
326018011	
326018012	
326018013	
326018014	
326018015	
326018016	
326018017	
326018018	
326018019	
326018020	Take it. It's yours, by right.
326018021	
326018022	
326018023	
326018024	
326018025	
326018026	
326018027	
326018028	
326018029	
326018030	Let us tread the path of the recusant together.
326018031	
326018032	
326018033	
326018034	
326018035	
326018036	
326018037	
326018038	
326018039	
326018040	Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.
326020000	So. You killed Rykard?
326020001	
326020002	
326020003	
326020004	
326020005	
326020006	
326020007	
326020008	
326020009	
326020010	I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.
326020011	
326020012	
326020013	
326020014	
326020015	
326020016	
326020017	
326020018	
326020019	
326020020	Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.
326020021	
326020022	
326020023	
326020024	
326020025	
326020026	
326020027	
326020028	
326020029	
326020030	But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more.
326020031	
326020032	
326020033	
326020034	
326020035	
326020036	
326020037	
326020038	
326020039	
326020040	Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.
326020041	
326020042	
326020043	
326020044	
326020045	
326020046	
326020047	
326020048	
326020049	
326020050	We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs.
326020051	
326020052	
326020053	
326020054	
326020055	
326020056	
326020057	
326020058	
326020059	
326020060	And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.
326021000	O Greater Will, hear my voice.
326021001	
326021002	
326021003	
326021004	
326021005	
326021006	
326021007	
326021008	
326021009	
326021010	I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.
326021011	
326021012	
326021013	
326021014	
326021015	
326021016	
326021017	
326021018	
326021019	
326021020	We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.
326030000	Who are you?
326030001	
326030002	
326030003	
326030004	
326030005	
326030006	
326030007	
326030008	
326030009	
326030010	And what in heaven's name are you doing here?
326030011	
326030012	
326030013	
326030014	
326030015	
326030016	
326030017	
326030018	
326030019	
326030020	The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.
326030021	
326030022	
326030023	
326030024	
326030025	
326030026	
326030027	
326030028	
326030029	
326030030	I hope you understand the weight of my words.
326040000	Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
326040001	
326040002	
326040003	
326040004	
326040005	
326040006	
326040007	
326040008	
326040009	
326040010	You have harboured doubts from the very beginning.
326040011	
326040012	
326040013	
326040014	
326040015	
326040016	
326040017	
326040018	
326040019	
326040020	Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon.
326040021	
326040022	
326040023	
326040024	
326040025	
326040026	
326040027	
326040028	
326040029	
326040030	But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
326040031	
326040032	
326040033	
326040034	
326040035	
326040036	
326040037	
326040038	
326040039	
326040040	Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
326041000	Then you must leave immediately.
326041001	
326041002	
326041003	
326041004	
326041005	
326041006	
326041007	
326041008	
326041009	
326041010	Those with weak stomachs have no place here.
326042000	I thought I told you to leave.
326042001	
326042002	
326042003	
326042004	
326042005	
326042006	
326042007	
326042008	
326042009	
326042010	Or do you claim to understand?
326042011	
326042012	
326042013	
326042014	
326042015	
326042016	
326042017	
326042018	
326042019	
326042020	What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own.
326043000	Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
326043001	
326043002	
326043003	
326043004	
326043005	
326043006	
326043007	
326043008	
326043009	
326043010	But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
326043011	
326043012	
326043013	
326043014	
326043015	
326043016	
326043017	
326043018	
326043019	
326043020	Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
326100000	Oh, a brew, is it?
326100001	
326100002	
326100003	
326100004	
326100005	
326100006	
326100007	
326100008	
326100009	
326100010	Thanking me for the battle arts?
326100011	
326100012	
326100013	
326100014	
326100015	
326100016	
326100017	
326100018	
326100019	
326100020	You're one of the good ones. Thank you.
326101000	Oh, a brew, is it?
326101001	
326101002	
326101003	
326101004	
326101005	
326101006	
326101007	
326101008	
326101009	
326101010	Fitting, I suppose.
326101011	
326101012	
326101013	
326101014	
326101015	
326101016	
326101017	
326101018	
326101019	
326101020	For a recusant already drunk on blasphemy.
326102000	<sleeping>
326800000	Agh!
326800001	
326800002	
326800003	
326800004	
326800005	
326800006	
326800007	
326800008	
326800009	
326800010	What's wrong with you?
326800011	
326800012	
326800013	
326800014	
326800015	
326800016	
326800017	
326800018	
326800019	
326800020	I won't say it twice. Stop this.
326801000	I suppose I have no choice, then.
326801001	
326801002	
326801003	
326801004	
326801005	
326801006	
326801007	
326801008	
326801009	
326801010	Is this what grace would have of us?
326802000	Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.
326803000	You are an enigma, to be certain.
326803001	
326803002	
326803003	
326803004	
326803005	
326803006	
326803007	
326803008	
326803009	
326803010	The Volcano Manor awaits you.
326900000	 
326900001	
326900002	
326900003	
326900004	
326900005	
326900006	
326900007	
326900008	
326900009	
326900010	 
326900011	
326900012	
326900013	
326900014	
326900015	
326900016	
326900017	
326900018	
326900019	
326900020	 
330001000	You're Tarnished, aren't you?
330001001	
330001002	
330001003	
330001004	
330001005	
330001006	
330001007	
330001008	
330001009	
330001010	I welcome you, to the Church of Vows.
330001011	
330001012	
330001013	
330001014	
330001015	
330001016	
330001017	
330001018	
330001019	
330001020	I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.
330001021	
330001022	
330001023	
330001024	
330001025	
330001026	
330001027	
330001028	
330001029	
330001030	My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.
330001031	
330001032	
330001033	
330001034	
330001035	
330001036	
330001037	
330001038	
330001039	
330001040	Do you know the origin of this place?
330001041	
330001042	
330001043	
330001044	
330001045	
330001046	
330001047	
330001048	
330001049	
330001050	How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?
330002000	Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you?
330002001	
330002002	
330002003	
330002004	
330002005	
330002006	
330002007	
330002008	
330002009	
330002010	The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear.
330002011	
330002012	
330002013	
330002014	
330002015	
330002016	
330002017	
330002018	
330002019	
330002020	It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined.
330002021	
330002022	
330002023	
330002024	
330002025	
330002026	
330002027	
330002028	
330002029	
330002030	By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon.
330002031	
330002032	
330002033	
330002034	
330002035	
330002036	
330002037	
330002038	
330002039	
330002040	And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses.
330002041	
330002042	
330002043	
330002044	
330002045	
330002046	
330002047	
330002048	
330002049	
330002050	The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
330003000	Oh, was there something you needed?
330003001	
330003002	
330003003	
330003004	
330003005	
330003006	
330003007	
330003008	
330003009	
330003010	You are free to show yourself around.
330003011	
330003012	
330003013	
330003014	
330003015	
330003016	
330003017	
330003018	
330003019	
330003020	I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be...
330003021	
330003022	
330003023	
330003024	
330003025	
330003026	
330003027	
330003028	
330003029	
330003030	If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.
330003031	
330003032	
330003033	
330003034	
330003035	
330003036	
330003037	
330003038	
330003039	
330003040	Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction?
330003041	
330003042	
330003043	
330003044	
330003045	
330003046	
330003047	
330003048	
330003049	
330003050	In which case, I will share all that I know.
330003051	
330003052	
330003053	
330003054	
330003055	
330003056	
330003057	
330003058	
330003059	
330003060	Whether it be sorcery or incantations, learning should not fetter you to one side or the other.
330003061	
330003062	
330003063	
330003064	
330003065	
330003066	
330003067	
330003068	
330003069	
330003070	This is, after all, a church celebrating the union of two such opposed practitioners.
330004000	Is there something else?
330010000	Greetings. Do you need anything?
330011000	Do you possess any celestial dew?
330011001	
330011002	
330011003	
330011004	
330011005	
330011006	
330011007	
330011008	
330011009	
330011010	Then I would like to share my knowledge with you.
330011011	
330011012	
330011013	
330011014	
330011015	
330011016	
330011017	
330011018	
330011019	
330011020	Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.
330011021	
330011022	
330011023	
330011024	
330011025	
330011026	
330011027	
330011028	
330011029	
330011030	Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew,
330011031	
330011032	
330011033	
330011034	
330011035	
330011036	
330011037	
330011038	
330011039	
330011040	repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala.
330011041	
330011042	
330011043	
330011044	
330011045	
330011046	
330011047	
330011048	
330011049	
330011050	The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.
330011051	
330011052	
330011053	
330011054	
330011055	
330011056	
330011057	
330011058	
330011059	
330011060	This miracle blesses the church to this day.
330011061	
330011062	
330011063	
330011064	
330011065	
330011066	
330011067	
330011068	
330011069	
330011070	And so, you need only follow Radagon's example,
330011071	
330011072	
330011073	
330011074	
330011075	
330011076	
330011077	
330011078	
330011079	
330011080	to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.
330012000	My faith does not waver.
330012001	
330012002	
330012003	
330012004	
330012005	
330012006	
330012007	
330012008	
330012009	
330012010	The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world.
330012011	
330012012	
330012013	
330012014	
330012015	
330012016	
330012017	
330012018	
330012019	
330012020	And this time, its bounty will not be squandered.
330012021	
330012022	
330012023	
330012024	
330012025	
330012026	
330012027	
330012028	
330012029	
330012030	If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished,
330012031	
330012032	
330012033	
330012034	
330012035	
330012036	
330012037	
330012038	
330012039	
330012040	I hope that you, too, will share my faith.
330014000	Are you taking the sword with you?
330014001	
330014002	
330014003	
330014004	
330014005	
330014006	
330014007	
330014008	
330014009	
330014010	Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you.
330014011	
330014012	
330014013	
330014014	
330014015	
330014016	
330014017	
330014018	
330014019	
330014020	Clearly, you are no conniving thief.
330014021	
330014022	
330014023	
330014024	
330014025	
330014026	
330014027	
330014028	
330014029	
330014030	The sword is telling us something, no doubt.
330014031	
330014032	
330014033	
330014034	
330014035	
330014036	
330014037	
330014038	
330014039	
330014040	Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground,
330014041	
330014042	
330014043	
330014044	
330014045	
330014046	
330014047	
330014048	
330014049	
330014050	it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand.
330014051	
330014052	
330014053	
330014054	
330014055	
330014056	
330014057	
330014058	
330014059	
330014060	Ah, now I recall.
330014061	
330014062	
330014063	
330014064	
330014065	
330014066	
330014067	
330014068	
330014069	
330014070	As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you.
330014071	
330014072	
330014073	
330014074	
330014075	
330014076	
330014077	
330014078	
330014079	
330014080	May you hold it high and proud.
330020000	Are you quite finished?
330020001	
330020002	
330020003	
330020004	
330020005	
330020006	
330020007	
330020008	
330020009	
330020010	Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions.
330020011	
330020012	
330020013	
330020014	
330020015	
330020016	
330020017	
330020018	
330020019	
330020020	Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving.
330020021	
330020022	
330020023	
330020024	
330020025	
330020026	
330020027	
330020028	
330020029	
330020030	Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain.
330020031	
330020032	
330020033	
330020034	
330020035	
330020036	
330020037	
330020038	
330020039	
330020040	And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain.
330021000	Are you quite finished?
330021001	
330021002	
330021003	
330021004	
330021005	
330021006	
330021007	
330021008	
330021009	
330021010	I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright.
330021011	
330021012	
330021013	
330021014	
330021015	
330021016	
330021017	
330021018	
330021019	
330021020	Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.
330021021	
330021022	
330021023	
330021024	
330021025	
330021026	
330021027	
330021028	
330021029	
330021030	My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.
330021031	
330021032	
330021033	
330021034	
330021035	
330021036	
330021037	
330021038	
330021039	
330021040	Do you know the origin of this place?
330021041	
330021042	
330021043	
330021044	
330021045	
330021046	
330021047	
330021048	
330021049	
330021050	How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?
330022000	Are you quite finished, now?
330031000	To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew.
330031001	
330031002	
330031003	
330031004	
330031005	
330031006	
330031007	
330031008	
330031009	
330031010	Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.
330033000	Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds.
330033001	
330033002	
330033003	
330033004	
330033005	
330033006	
330033007	
330033008	
330033009	
330033010	Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed...
330033011	
330033012	
330033013	
330033014	
330033015	
330033016	
330033017	
330033018	
330033019	
330033020	Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony.
330033021	
330033022	
330033023	
330033024	
330033025	
330033026	
330033027	
330033028	
330033029	
330033030	Be mindful, not to take for granted...
330033031	
330033032	
330033033	
330033034	
330033035	
330033036	
330033037	
330033038	
330033039	
330033040	the serenity restored by this miracle.
330033041	
330033042	
330033043	
330033044	
330033045	
330033046	
330033047	
330033048	
330033049	
330033050	And take care. Never to break a bond again.
330050000	You wish to know more of Lord Radagon?
330050001	
330050002	
330050003	
330050004	
330050005	
330050006	
330050007	
330050008	
330050009	
330050010	Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks.
330050011	
330050012	
330050013	
330050014	
330050015	
330050016	
330050017	
330050018	
330050019	
330050020	He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.
330050021	
330050022	
330050023	
330050024	
330050025	
330050026	
330050027	
330050028	
330050029	
330050030	He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.
330050031	
330050032	
330050033	
330050034	
330050035	
330050036	
330050037	
330050038	
330050039	
330050040	However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between,
330050041	
330050042	
330050043	
330050044	
330050045	
330050046	
330050047	
330050048	
330050049	
330050050	Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort.
330050051	
330050052	
330050053	
330050054	
330050055	
330050056	
330050057	
330050058	
330050059	
330050060	Taking the title...of second Elden Lord.
330050061	
330050062	
330050063	
330050064	
330050065	
330050066	
330050067	
330050068	
330050069	
330050070	The mystery endures, to this day...
330050071	
330050072	
330050073	
330050074	
330050075	
330050076	
330050077	
330050078	
330050079	
330050080	As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside...
330050081	
330050082	
330050083	
330050084	
330050085	
330050086	
330050087	
330050088	
330050089	
330050090	And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord...
330051000	You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret...
330051001	
330051002	
330051003	
330051004	
330051005	
330051006	
330051007	
330051008	
330051009	
330051010	A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature.
330051011	
330051012	
330051013	
330051014	
330051015	
330051016	
330051017	
330051018	
330051019	
330051020	When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet.
330051021	
330051022	
330051023	
330051024	
330051025	
330051026	
330051027	
330051028	
330051029	
330051030	And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too.
330052000	You wish to know more of Lady Rennala?
330052001	
330052002	
330052003	
330052004	
330052005	
330052006	
330052007	
330052008	
330052009	
330052010	She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
330052011	
330052012	
330052013	
330052014	
330052015	
330052016	
330052017	
330052018	
330052019	
330052020	The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch.
330052021	
330052022	
330052023	
330052024	
330052025	
330052026	
330052027	
330052028	
330052029	
330052030	Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.
330052031	
330052032	
330052033	
330052034	
330052035	
330052036	
330052037	
330052038	
330052039	
330052040	And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.
330053000	In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her.
330053001	
330053002	
330053003	
330053004	
330053005	
330053006	
330053007	
330053008	
330053009	
330053010	Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite;
330053011	
330053012	
330053013	
330053014	
330053015	
330053016	
330053017	
330053018	
330053019	
330053020	the grim art of reincarnation.
330053021	
330053022	
330053023	
330053024	
330053025	
330053026	
330053027	
330053028	
330053029	
330053030	You would do well to remember...
330053031	
330053032	
330053033	
330053034	
330053035	
330053036	
330053037	
330053038	
330053039	
330053040	Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire.
330060000	Why, this is nectar, is it not?
330060001	
330060002	
330060003	
330060004	
330060005	
330060006	
330060007	
330060008	
330060009	
330060010	And you're giving it to me?
330060011	
330060012	
330060013	
330060014	
330060015	
330060016	
330060017	
330060018	
330060019	
330060020	Oh, wonderful, just wonderful.
330060021	
330060022	
330060023	
330060024	
330060025	
330060026	
330060027	
330060028	
330060029	
330060030	Truth be told, I'm rather fond of the stuff.
330060031	
330060032	
330060033	
330060034	
330060035	
330060036	
330060037	
330060038	
330060039	
330060040	I'll happily take it off your hands!
330061000	<sleeping>
330100000	Oh, what have we here?
330100001	
330100002	
330100003	
330100004	
330100005	
330100006	
330100007	
330100008	
330100009	
330100010	Very well, let us both learn together.
330100011	
330100012	
330100013	
330100014	
330100015	
330100016	
330100017	
330100018	
330100019	
330100020	Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance.
330100021	
330100022	
330100023	
330100024	
330100025	
330100026	
330100027	
330100028	
330100029	
330100030	All things can be conjoined.
330800000	Mngh!
330801000	Stop it, please.
330801001	
330801002	
330801003	
330801004	
330801005	
330801006	
330801007	
330801008	
330801009	
330801010	My flesh is akin to stone.
330802000	I cannot be wounded. I cannot die.
330802001	
330802002	
330802003	
330802004	
330802005	
330802006	
330802007	
330802008	
330802009	
330802010	But nor will I cause any harm unto you.
330802011	
330802012	
330802013	
330802014	
330802015	
330802016	
330802017	
330802018	
330802019	
330802020	Cease your futile efforts.
330803000	Well, aren't we determined.
330803001	
330803002	
330803003	
330803004	
330803005	
330803006	
330803007	
330803008	
330803009	
330803010	...
330804000	...
330805000	Aaa...aaargh!
331001000	What are you lookin' at?
331001001	
331001002	
331001003	
331001004	
331001005	
331001006	
331001007	
331001008	
331001009	
331001010	You trying to start something, mate?
331002000	Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it?
331002001	
331002002	
331002003	
331002004	
331002005	
331002006	
331002007	
331002008	
331002009	
331002010	Hmm, well…
331002011	
331002012	
331002013	
331002014	
331002015	
331002016	
331002017	
331002018	
331002019	
331002020	Show me what it's worth to you,
331002021	
331002022	
331002023	
331002024	
331002025	
331002026	
331002027	
331002028	
331002029	
331002030	and I'll consider parting ways with it.
331002031	
331002032	
331002033	
331002034	
331002035	
331002036	
331002037	
331002038	
331002039	
331002040	I'm not in love with it or nothing.
331003000	You're a shrewd one, chief.
331003001	
331003002	
331003003	
331003004	
331003005	
331003006	
331003007	
331003008	
331003009	
331003010	First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither.
331003011	
331003012	
331003013	
331003014	
331003015	
331003016	
331003017	
331003018	
331003019	
331003020	Hmm...
331003021	
331003022	
331003023	
331003024	
331003025	
331003026	
331003027	
331003028	
331003029	
331003030	Alright. Take it.
331003031	
331003032	
331003033	
331003034	
331003035	
331003036	
331003037	
331003038	
331003039	
331003040	Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway.
331003041	
331003042	
331003043	
331003044	
331003045	
331003046	
331003047	
331003048	
331003049	
331003050	Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later.
331004000	Oh piss off, what is it now?
331004001	
331004002	
331004003	
331004004	
331004005	
331004006	
331004007	
331004008	
331004009	
331004010	Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn?
331004011	
331004012	
331004013	
331004014	
331004015	
331004016	
331004017	
331004018	
331004019	
331004020	Freshly cooked, it is.
331004021	
331004022	
331004023	
331004024	
331004025	
331004026	
331004027	
331004028	
331004029	
331004030	Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price.
331004031	
331004032	
331004033	
331004034	
331004035	
331004036	
331004037	
331004038	
331004039	
331004040	I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes.
331005000	What the hell is wrong with you.
331005001	
331005002	
331005003	
331005004	
331005005	
331005006	
331005007	
331005008	
331005009	
331005010	You trying to start something?
331005011	
331005012	
331005013	
331005014	
331005015	
331005016	
331005017	
331005018	
331005019	
331005020	Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf.
331006000	This bloody swine...
331006001	
331006002	
331006003	
331006004	
331006005	
331006006	
331006007	
331006008	
331006009	
331006010	Decided to play ball now, 'ave you?
331006110	You'll be wantin' the necklace, then?
331007000	Think you're bloody clever, do ya?
331007001	
331007002	
331007003	
331007004	
331007005	
331007006	
331007007	
331007008	
331007009	
331007010	Then how about you piss off?
331007110	fore I crack you in 'alf.
331010000	Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.
331011000	Alright mate. Want some more prawn, do ya?

331011006	
331011007	
331011008	
331011009	
331011010	Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya?
331012000	Never met someone with a taste for prawn I couldn't trust.
331012001	
331012002	
331012003	
331012004	
331012005	
331012006	
331012007	
331012008	
331012009	
331012010	We'd make good mates, I reckon.
331012011	
331012012	
331012013	
331012014	
331012015	
331012016	
331012017	
331012018	
331012019	
331012020	I'll be seeing ya.
331015000	Oh, so you met the girl, did ya?
331015001	
331015002	
331015003	
331015004	
331015005	
331015006	
331015007	
331015008	
331015009	
331015010	Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter,
331015011	
331015012	
331015013	
331015014	
331015015	
331015016	
331015017	
331015018	
331015019	
331015020	But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it.
331015021	
331015022	
331015023	
331015024	
331015025	
331015026	
331015027	
331015028	
331015029	
331015030	Anyway, she ain't all right, that one.
331015031	
331015032	
331015033	
331015034	
331015035	
331015036	
331015037	
331015038	
331015039	
331015040	Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon.
331016000	You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha?
331016001	
331016002	
331016003	
331016004	
331016005	
331016006	
331016007	
331016008	
331016009	
331016010	Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean.
331016011	
331016012	
331016013	
331016014	
331016015	
331016016	
331016017	
331016018	
331016019	
331016020	I can't see it at all no more.
331016021	
331016022	
331016023	
331016024	
331016025	
331016026	
331016027	
331016028	
331016029	
331016030	Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between.
331016031	
331016032	
331016033	
331016034	
331016035	
331016036	
331016037	
331016038	
331016039	
331016040	Cruel bloody joke, you ask me.
331016041	
331016042	
331016043	
331016044	
331016045	
331016046	
331016047	
331016048	
331016049	
331016050	Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time.
331016051	
331016052	
331016053	
331016054	
331016055	
331016056	
331016057	
331016058

331017000	You what? Sod the particulars, mate.
331017001	
331017002	
331017003	
331017004	
331017005	
331017006	
331017007	
331017008	
331017009	
331017010	Ain't my fault people are so bloody stupid, is it?
331017011	
331017012	
331017013	
331017014	
331017015	
331017016	
331017017	
331017018	
331017019	
331017020	Don't like that it's stolen? Don't sodding buy it...
331020000	What are you lookin' at?
331020001	
331020002	
331020003	
331020004	
331020005	
331020006	
331020007	
331020008	
331020009	
331020010	Oh...you again, is it.
331020011	
331020012

331020015	
331020016	
331020017	
331020018	
331020019	
331020020	Perfect bloody timing, actually.
331020021

331020027	
331020028	
331020029	
331020030	I got crab, cooked up fresh.
331021000	Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.
331022000	Alright mate. Want some more crab, do ya?
331022001	
331022002	
331022003	
331022004

331023007	
331023008	
331023009	
331023010	We've got a real thing here, eh, and it's only gettin' better.
331025000	Mate, there's somethin' I should probably tell ya.
331025001	
331025002	
331025003	
331025004	
331025005	
331025006	
331025007	
331025008	
331025009	
331025010	You 'eard of the Dung Eater?
331025011	
331025012	
331025013	
331025014	
331025015	
331025016	
331025017	
331025018	
331025019	
331025020	E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all.
331025021	
331025022	
331025023	
331025024	
331025025	
331025026	
331025027	
331025028	
331025029	
331025030	You see 'im though, stay well away.
331025031	
331025032	
331025033	
331025034	
331025035	
331025036	
331025037	
331025038	
331025039	
331025040	I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and.
331025041	
331025042	
331025043	
331025044	
331025045

331025047	
331025048	
331025049	
331025050	E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me.
331026000	E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls...
331026001	
331026002	
331026003

331026005	
331026006	
331026007	
331026008	
331026009	
331026010	Does all sorts of shit to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever.
331026011	
331026012	
331026013	
331026014	
331026015	
331026016	
331026017	
331026018	
331026019	
331026020	I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years.

331026027	
331026028	
331026029	
331026030	I ain't ever been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot...
331026031	
331026032	
331026033	
331026034	
331026035	
331026036	
331026037	
331026038	
331026039	
331026040	While 'e did all that, to my friend...
331027000	Yeah...and now I seen it 'ere, again.
331027001	
331027002	
331027003	
331027004	
331027005	
331027006	
331027007	
331027008	
331027009	
331027010	Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies.
331027011	
331027012	
331027013	
331027014

332002047	
332002048

332002050	Worthy Tarnished, brandish the spear, and run him through.

332002053	
332002054

332002057	
332002058	
332002059	
332002060	The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity.
332003000	Praetor Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign.
332003001	
332003002	
332003003

332003007	
332003008	
332003009	
332003010	But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity, once he gave himself to the serpent.

332003014

332003030	Someone must kill him.

332003034	
332003035	
332003036	
332003037	
332003038	
332003039	
332003040	To spare him, and his ambitions, from further dishonour.
332004000	Worthy Tarnished. I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.
332004001	
332004002	
332004003	
332004004

332004007	
332004008	
332004009	
332004010	It is the only thing that can kill that horror.

332004016	
332004017	
332004018	
332004019	
332004020	Run it through. The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity...
333001000	You're Tarnished, aren't you?
333001001	
333001002	
333001003

333002040	Only, none of them are particularly great...
333003000	Back to learn another?

333003007	
333003008	
333003009	
333003010	Wonderful. You're most welcome, to any of my anaemic little spells.
333004000	Back to learn another?

333004008	
333004009	
333004010	Why, of course.
333005000	Well, I can't blame you, I suppose.
333005001	
333005002

333005017	
333005018	
333005019	
333005020	just speak up, loud and clear.
333006000	Oh, there you are.

333020062	
333020063	
333020064	
333020065	
333020066	
333020067	
333020068	
333020069	
333020070	After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,
333020071	
333020072	
333020073	
333020074	
333020075	
333020076	
333020077	
333020078	
333020079	
333020080	the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.
333020100	As you might have guessed, the seals are still active,
333020101	
333020102	
333020103	
333020104	
333020105	
333020106	
333020107	
333020108	
333020109	
333020110	making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.
333020111	
333020112	
333020113	
333020114	
333020115	
333020116	
333020117	
333020118	
333020119	
333020120	And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.
333020121	
333020122	
333020123	
333020124	
333020125	
333020126	
333020127	
333020128	
333020129	
333020130	When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.
333021000	Why not find yourself a glintstone key?
333021001	
333021002	
333021003	
333021004	
333021005	
333021006	
333021007	
333021008	
333021009	
333021010	Without one, you can't pass through the academy,
333021011	
333021012	
333021013	
333021014	
333021015	
333021016	
333021017	
333021018	
333021019	
333021020	and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.
333021021	
333021022	
333021023	
333021024	
333021025	
333021026	
333021027	
333021028	
333021029	
333021030	And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...
333021031	
333021032	
333021033	
333021034	
333021035	
333021036	
333021037	
333021038	
333021039	
333021040	Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient -
333021041	
333021042	
333021043	
333021044	
333021045	
333021046	
333021047	
333021048	
333021049	
333021050	would you consider donating it to me?
333021051	
333021052	
333021053	
333021054	
333021055	
333021056	
333021057	
333021058	
333021059	
333021060	I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.
333021061	
333021062	
333021063	
333021064	
333021065	
333021066	
333021067	
333021068	
333021069	
333021070	But still, my place is at the academy...
333022000	Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics...
333022001	
333022002	
333022003	
333022004	
333022005	
333022006	
333022007	
333022008	
333022009	
333022010	...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City.
333022011	
333022012	
333022013	
333022014	
333022015	
333022016	
333022017	
333022018	
333022019	
333022020	The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs.
333022021	
333022022	
333022023	
333022024	
333022025	
333022026	
333022027	
333022028	
333022029	
333022030	And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched.
333023000	Thank you, kind soul.
333023001	
333023002	
333023003	
333023004	
333023005	
333023006	
333023007	
333023008	
333023009	
333023010	For learning my paltry sorceries.
333023011	
333023012	
333023013	
333023014	
333023015	
333023016	
333023017	
333023018	
333023019	
333023020	I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.
333024000	Are you certain?
333024001	
333024002	
333024003	
333024004	
333024005	
333024006	
333024007	
333024008	
333024009	
333024010	You're willing to give your glintstone key to me?
333024011	
333024012	
333024013	
333024014	
333024015	
333024016	
333024017	
333024018	
333024019	
333024020	…My oh my!
333024021	
333024022	
333024023	
333024024	
333024025	
333024026	
333024027	
333024028	
333024029	
333024030	Thank you, thank you dearly.
333024031	
333024032	
333024033	
333024034	
333024035	
333024036	
333024037	
333024038	
333024039	
333024040	Now I can go back to the academy.
333024041	
333024042	
333024043	
333024044	
333024045	
333024046	
333024047	
333024048	
333024049	
333024050	To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars.
333024051	
333024052	
333024053	
333024054	
333024055	
333024056	
333024057	
333024058	
333024059	
333024060	...
333025000	You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?
333025001	
333025002	
333025003	
333025004	
333025005	
333025006	
333025007	
333025008	
333025009	
333025010	Well, that is something.
333025011	
333025012	
333025013	
333025014	
333025015	
333025016	
333025017	
333025018	
333025019	
333025020	Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.
333025021	
333025022	
333025023	
333025024	
333025025	
333025026	
333025027	
333025028	
333025029	
333025030	I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.
333025031	
333025032	
333025033	
333025034	
333025035	
333025036	
333025037	
333025038	
333025039	
333025040	But Sellen was expelled from the academy.
333025041	
333025042	
333025043	
333025044	
333025045	
333025046	
333025047	
333025048	
333025049	
333025050	Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.
333025051	
333025052	
333025053	
333025054	
333025055	
333025056	
333025057	
333025058	
333025059	
333025060	I still don't believe the accusations.
333025061	
333025062	
333025063	
333025064	
333025065	
333025066	
333025067	
333025068	
333025069	
333025070	The illustrious Sellen would never do such things...
333026000	Find yourself a glintstone key.
333026001	
333026002	
333026003	
333026004	
333026005	
333026006	
333026007	
333026008	
333026009	
333026010	Without one, you can't pass through the academy,
333026011	
333026012	
333026013	
333026014	
333026015	
333026016	
333026017	
333026018	
333026019	
333026020	and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.
333030000	Well, what's this?
333030001	
333030002	
333030003	
333030004	
333030005	
333030006	
333030007	
333030008	
333030009	
333030010	For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew?
333030011	
333030012	
333030013	
333030014	
333030015	
333030016	
333030017	
333030018	
333030019	
333030020	My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward.
333030021	
333030022	
333030023	
333030024	
333030025	
333030026	
333030027	
333030028	
333030029	
333030030	Oh, bless you.
333030031	
333030032	
333030033	
333030034	
333030035	
333030036	
333030037	
333030038	
333030039	
333030040	I'll save it for a special occasion.
333030041	
333030042	
333030043	
333030044	
333030045	
333030046	
333030047	
333030048	
333030049	
333030050	I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live.
333031000	...
333040000	So, you've found yourself a glintstone key.
333040001	
333040002	
333040003	
333040004	
333040005	
333040006	
333040007	
333040008	
333040009	
333040010	But I certainly can't take it from you.
333040011	
333040012	
333040013	
333040014	
333040015	
333040016	
333040017	
333040018	
333040019	
333040020	That key belongs to you.
333040021	
333040022	
333040023	
333040024	
333040025	
333040026	
333040027	
333040028	
333040029	
333040030	By rights, you should use it for yourself.
333040031	
333040032	
333040033	
333040034	
333040035	
333040036	
333040037	
333040038	
333040039	
333040040	It's true, I wish to return to my place of study.
333040041	
333040042	
333040043	
333040044	
333040045	
333040046	
333040047	
333040048	
333040049	
333040050	But that's no excuse to impose upon others.
333040051	
333040052	
333040053	
333040054	
333040055	
333040056	
333040057	
333040058	
333040059	
333040060	Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last?
333041000	Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
333041001	
333041002	
333041003	
333041004	
333041005	
333041006	
333041007	
333041008	
333041009	
333041010	Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight.
333041011	
333041012	
333041013	
333041014	
333041015	
333041016	
333041017	
333041018	
333041019	
333041020	Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.
333051000	Thank you dearly.
333051001	
333051002	
333051003	
333051004	
333051005	
333051006	
333051007	
333051008	
333051009	
333051010	With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
333051011	
333051012	
333051013	
333051014	
333051015	
333051016	
333051017	
333051018	
333051019	
333051020	Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit?
333051021	
333051022	
333051023	
333051024	
333051025	
333051026	
333051027	
333051028	
333051029	
333051030	Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then!
333051031	
333051032	
333051033	
333051034	
333051035	
333051036	
333051037	
333051038	
333051039	
333051040	Ha ha!
333100000	Oh, did I not mention?
333100001	
333100002	
333100003	
333100004	
333100005	
333100006	
333100007	
333100008	
333100009	
333100010	I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power.
333100011	
333100012	
333100013	
333100014	
333100015	
333100016	
333100017	
333100018	
333100019	
333100020	So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll.
333100021	
333100022	
333100023	
333100024	
333100025	
333100026	
333100027	
333100028	
333100029	
333100030	I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am.
333800000	Ow!
333801000	What's wrong with you?
333801001	
333801002	
333801003	
333801004	
333801005	
333801006	
333801007	
333801008	
333801009	
333801010	Stop that, now. Please.
333802000	There's no getting through to you, is there.
333803000	...
333803001	
333803002	
333803003	
333803004	
333803005	
333803006	
333803007	
333803008	
333803009	
333803010	Why on earth...
333804000	Oh, Raya... Lucaria...
333804001	
333804002	
333804003	
333804004	
333804005	
333804006	
333804007	
333804008	
333804009	
333804010	The home of my studies...
333900000	 
333900001	
333900002	
333900003	
333900004	
333900005	
333900006	
333900007	
333900008	
333900009	
333900010	 
333900011	
333900012	
333900013	
333900014	
333900015	
333900016	
333900017	
333900018	
333900019	
333900020	 
334001000	Be proud. You were a fine warrior.
334001001	
334001002	
334001003	
334001004	
334001005	
334001006	
334001007	
334001008	
334001009	
334001010	Your only mistake was your choice of master.
334001011	
334001012	
334001013	
334001014	
334001015	
334001016	
334001017	
334001018	
334001019	
334001020	Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.
334002000	Well, who do we have here?
334002001	
334002002	
334002003	
334002004	
334002005	
334002006	
334002007	
334002008	
334002009	
334002010	
334002011	
334002012	
334002013	
334002014	
334002015	
334002016	
334002017	
334002018	
334002019	
334002020	Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.
334002021	
334002022	
334002023	
334002024	
334002025	
334002026	
334002027	
334002028	
334002029	
334002030	I am Nepheli Loux. Tarnished and warrior, like you.
334002031	
334002032	
334002033	
334002034	
334002035	
334002036	
334002037	
334002038	
334002039	
334002040	I'm here by decree of my father.
334002041	
334002042	
334002043	
334002044	
334002045	
334002046	
334002047	
334002048	
334002049	
334002050	How utterly repellant this is.
334002051	
334002052	
334002053	
334002054	
334002055	
334002056	
334002057	
334002058	
334002059	
334002060	This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.
334002061	
334002062	
334002063	
334002064	
334002065	
334002066	
334002067	
334002068	
334002069	
334002070	He's tainted the very winds.
334003000	If you intend to challenge Godrick,
334003001	
334003002	
334003003	
334003004	
334003005	
334003006	
334003007	
334003008	
334003009	
334003010	I ask you call upon me.
334003011	
334003012	
334003013	
334003014	
334003015	
334003016	
334003017	
334003018	
334003019	
334003020	The winds run foul with his deeds.
334003021	
334003022	
334003023	
334003024	
334003025	
334003026	
334003027	
334003028	
334003029	
334003030	I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.
334004000	Apologies, but I've idled long enough.
334004001	
334004002	
334004003	
334004004	
334004005	
334004006	
334004007	
334004008	
334004009	
334004010	As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance.
334004011	
334004012	
334004013	
334004014	
334004015	
334004016	
334004017	
334004018	
334004019	
334004020	Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.
334010000	You again...
334010001	
334010002	
334010003	
334010004	
334010005	
334010006	
334010007	
334010008	
334010009	
334010010	I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.
334010011	
334010012	
334010013	
334010014	
334010015	
334010016	
334010017	
334010018	
334010019	
334010020	Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
334010021	
334010022	
334010023	
334010024	
334010025	
334010026	
334010027	
334010028	
334010029	
334010030	I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.
334010031	
334010032	
334010033	
334010034	
334010035	
334010036	
334010037	
334010038	
334010039	
334010040	I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.
334010041	
334010042	
334010043	
334010044	
334010045	
334010046	
334010047	
334010048	
334010049	
334010050	You defeated him. You should have it.
334010051	
334010052	
334010053	
334010054	
334010055	
334010056	
334010057	
334010058	
334010059	
334010060	Make good use of it.
334010061	
334010062	
334010063	
334010064	
334010065	
334010066	
334010067	
334010068	
334010069	
334010070	I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
334010071	
334010072	
334010073	
334010074	
334010075	
334010076	
334010077	
334010078	
334010079	
334010080	You again...
334010081	
334010082	
334010083	
334010084	
334010085	
334010086	
334010087	
334010088	
334010089	
334010090	I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.
334010091	
334010092	
334010093	
334010094	
334010095	
334010096	
334010097	
334010098	
334010099	
334010100	Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
334010101	
334010102	
334010103	
334010104	
334010105	
334010106	
334010107	
334010108	
334010109	
334010110	I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.
334010111	
334010112	
334010113	
334010114	
334010115	
334010116	
334010117	
334010118	
334010119	
334010120	I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.
334010121	
334010122	
334010123	
334010124	
334010125	
334010126	
334010127	
334010128	
334010129	
334010130	You were the one to defeat him, I would hazard?
334010131	
334010132	
334010133	
334010134	
334010135	
334010136	
334010137	
334010138	
334010139	
334010140	Make good use of it.
334010141	
334010142	
334010143	
334010144	
334010145	
334010146	
334010147	
334010148	
334010149	
334010150	I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
334011000	Ah, yes.
334011001	
334011002	
334011003	
334011004	
334011005	
334011006	
334011007	
334011008	
334011009	
334011010	I wonder if you've met my foster father?
334011011	
334011012	
334011013	
334011014	
334011015	
334011016	
334011017	
334011018	
334011019	
334011020	He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.
334011021	
334011022	
334011023	
334011024	
334011025	
334011026	
334011027	
334011028	
334011029	
334011030	If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.
334011031	
334011032	
334011033	
334011034	
334011035	
334011036	
334011037	
334011038	
334011039	
334011040	Father is leader of the Roundtable.
334011041	
334011042	
334011043	
334011044	
334011045	
334011046	
334011047	
334011048	
334011049	
334011050	I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.
334012000	It's about time I headed off.
334012001	
334012002	
334012003	
334012004	
334012005	
334012006	
334012007	
334012008	
334012009	
334012010	I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.
334018000	You again...
334018001	
334018002	
334018003	
334018004	
334018005	
334018006	
334018007	
334018008	
334018009	
334018010	You received a summons to the Roundtable?
334018011	
334018012	
334018013	
334018014	
334018015	
334018016	
334018017	
334018018	
334018019	
334018020	Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
334018021	
334018022	
334018023	
334018024	
334018025	
334018026	
334018027	
334018028	
334018029	
334018030	The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.
334019000	Oh, hello.
334019001	
334019002	
334019003	
334019004	
334019005	
334019006	
334019007	
334019008	
334019009	
334019010	I've not seen you here before.
334019011	
334019012	
334019013	
334019014	
334019015	
334019016	
334019017	
334019018	
334019019	
334019020	I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
334019021	
334019022	
334019023	
334019024	
334019025	
334019026	
334019027	
334019028	
334019029	
334019030	Here by decree of my father.
334019031	
334019032	
334019033	
334019034	
334019035	
334019036	
334019037	
334019038	
334019039	
334019040	The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.
334020000	Is that some kind of medicine?
334020001	
334020002	
334020003	
334020004	
334020005	
334020006	
334020007	
334020008	
334020009	
334020010	One that affects the heart, I'd wager.
334020011	
334020012	
334020013	
334020014	
334020015	
334020016	
334020017	
334020018	
334020019	
334020020	If it's what I think, I have no need of it.
334020021	
334020022	
334020023	
334020024	
334020025	
334020026	
334020027	
334020028	
334020029	
334020030	I am a warrior.
334020031	
334020032	
334020033	
334020034	
334020035	
334020036	
334020037	
334020038	
334020039	
334020040	I need no external aid.
334020041	
334020042	
334020043	
334020044	
334020045	
334020046	
334020047	
334020048	
334020049	
334020050	Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve.
334030000	Oh, it's you...
334030001	
334030002	
334030003	
334030004	
334030005	
334030006	
334030007	
334030008	
334030009	
334030010	
334030011	
334030012	
334030013	
334030014	
334030015	
334030016	
334030017	
334030018	
334030019	
334030020	Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?
334030021	
334030022	
334030023	
334030024	
334030025	
334030026	
334030027	
334030028	
334030029	
334030030	I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.
334030031	
334030032	
334030033	
334030034	
334030035	
334030036	
334030037	
334030038	
334030039	
334030040	The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.
334030041	
334030042	
334030043	
334030044	
334030045	
334030046	
334030047	
334030048	
334030049	
334030050	A waking nightmare, made by men.
334031000	But this time, I'm a woman grown.
334031001	
334031002	
334031003	
334031004	
334031005	
334031006	
334031007	
334031008	
334031009	
334031010	And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.
334031011	
334031012	
334031013	
334031014	
334031015	
334031016	
334031017	
334031018	
334031019	
334031020	Justice to the oppressors.
334031021	
334031022	
334031023	
334031024	
334031025	
334031026	
334031027	
334031028	
334031029	
334031030	Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
334040000	Ah, you...
334040001	
334040002	
334040003	
334040004	
334040005	
334040006	
334040007	
334040008	
334040009	
334040010	Please, leave me be.
334040011	
334040012	
334040013	
334040014	
334040015	
334040016	
334040017	
334040018	
334040019	
334040020	It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.
334041000	...So you know already, do you?
334041001	
334041002	
334041003	
334041004	
334041005	
334041006	
334041007	
334041008	
334041009	
334041010	Right. It's true. My father cast me out.
334041011	
334041012	
334041013	
334041014	
334041015	
334041016	
334041017	
334041018	
334041019	
334041020	For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.
334041021	
334041022	
334041023	
334041024	
334041025	
334041026	
334041027	
334041028	
334041029	
334041030	Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.
334041031	
334041032	
334041033	
334041034	
334041035	
334041036	
334041037	
334041038	
334041039	
334041040	I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.
334041041	
334041042	
334041043	
334041044	
334041045	
334041046	
334041047	
334041048	
334041049	
334041050	And yet I... Though it was not my intent...
334041051	
334041052	
334041053	
334041054	
334041055	
334041056	
334041057	
334041058	
334041059	
334041060	I betrayed him...
334042000	I...can no longer trust in father...
334042001	
334042002	
334042003	
334042004	
334042005	
334042006	
334042007	
334042008	
334042009	
334042010	To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy...
334042011	
334042012	
334042013	
334042014	
334042015	
334042016	
334042017	
334042018	
334042019	
334042020	Where is the justice he purports, in that?
334042021	
334042022	
334042023	
334042024	
334042025	
334042026	
334042027	
334042028	
334042029	
334042030	He once told me that if he became Elden Lord,
334042031	
334042032	
334042033	
334042034	
334042035	
334042036	
334042037	
334042038	
334042039	
334042040	he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.
334042041	
334042042	
334042043	
334042044	
334042045	
334042046	
334042047	
334042048	
334042049	
334042050	Was he simply lying to me?
334043000	No, no, no...
334043001	
334043002	
334043003	
334043004	
334043005	
334043006	
334043007	
334043008	
334043009	
334043010	How could I say that?
334043011	
334043012	
334043013	
334043014	
334043015	
334043016	
334043017	
334043018	
334043019	
334043020	Father has always given me his guidance...
334043021	
334043022	
334043023	
334043024	
334043025	
334043026	
334043027	
334043028	
334043029	
334043030	And now...I've lost it...
334043031	
334043032	
334043033	
334043034	
334043035	
334043036	
334043037	
334043038	
334043039	
334043040	...
334050000	Medicine, is it?
334050001	
334050002	
334050003	
334050004	
334050005	
334050006	
334050007	
334050008	
334050009	
334050010	Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good.
334050011	
334050012	
334050013	
334050014	
334050015	
334050016	
334050017	
334050018	
334050019	
334050020	...
334050021	
334050022	
334050023	
334050024	
334050025	
334050026	
334050027	
334050028	
334050029	
334050030	It's very sweet...isn't it...
334050031	
334050032	
334050033	
334050034	
334050035	
334050036	
334050037	
334050038	
334050039	
334050040	And very...very...
334050041	
334050042	
334050043	
334050044	
334050045	
334050046	
334050047	
334050048	
334050049	
334050050	...
334060000	Is that ash?
334060001	
334060002	
334060003	
334060004	
334060005	
334060006	
334060007	
334060008	
334060009	
334060010	I can smell the ancient storm in it...
334060030	My thanks. I'll gladly take it.
334061000	I'm...not like Roderika.
334061001	
334061002	
334061003	
334061004	
334061005	
334061006	
334061007	
334061008	
334061009	
334061010	I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.
334061011	
334061012	
334061013	
334061014	
334061015	
334061016	
334061017	
334061018	
334061019	
334061020	Still, this ash...
334061021	
334061022	
334061023	
334061024	
334061025	
334061026	
334061027	
334061028	
334061029	
334061030	It reminds me of my first hawk.
334061031	
334061032	
334061033	
334061034	
334061035	
334061036	
334061037	
334061038	
334061039	
334061040	Thank you.
334062000	In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.
334062001	
334062002	
334062003	
334062004	
334062005	
334062006	
334062007	
334062008	
334062009	
334062010	It reminds me of my first hawk.
334070000	It's been some time.
334070001	
334070002	
334070003	
334070004	
334070005	
334070006	
334070007	
334070008	
334070009	
334070010	I must thank you, for your aid.
334070011	
334070012	
334070013	
334070014	
334070015	
334070016	
334070017	
334070018	
334070019	
334070020	I told father I would be with him no longer.
334070021	
334070022	
334070023	
334070024	
334070025	
334070026	
334070027	
334070028	
334070029	
334070030	I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.
334070031	
334070032	
334070033	
334070034	
334070035	
334070036	
334070037	
334070038	
334070039	
334070040	This land is much like the one from which I hail.
334070041	
334070042	
334070043	
334070044	
334070045	
334070046	
334070047	
334070048	
334070049	
334070050	I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.
334071000	Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
334071001	
334071002	
334071003	
334071004	
334071005	
334071006	
334071007	
334071008	
334071009	
334071010	Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.
334071011	
334071012	
334071013	
334071014	
334071015	
334071016	
334071017	
334071018	
334071019	
334071020	Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.
334071021	
334071022	
334071023	
334071024	
334071025	
334071026	
334071027	
334071028	
334071029	
334071030	I cannot express how much you've helped me.
334071031	
334071032	
334071033	
334071034	
334071035	
334071036	
334071037	
334071038	
334071039	
334071040	Should you become Elden Lord.
334071041	
334071042	
334071043	
334071044	
334071045	
334071046	
334071047	
334071048	
334071049	
334071050	I would gladly lighten your burden.
334072000	Farewell, fellow warrior.
334072001	
334072002	
334072003	
334072004	
334072005	
334072006	
334072007	
334072008	
334072009	
334072010	I will remain, to summon the storm.
334072011	
334072012	
334072013	
334072014	
334072015	
334072016	
334072017	
334072018	
334072019	
334072020	But your guidance, and your fight...
334072021	
334072022	
334072023	
334072024	
334072025	
334072026	
334072027	
334072028	
334072029	
334072030	Surely lie elsewhere.
334073000	I will remain, to summon the storm.
334073001	
334073002	
334073003	
334073004	
334073005	
334073006	
334073007	
334073008	
334073009	
334073010	But your guidance, and your fight...
334073011	
334073012	
334073013	
334073014	
334073015	
334073016	
334073017	
334073018	
334073019	
334073020	Surely lie elsewhere.
334800000	 
334801000	What do you intend?
334801001	
334801002	
334801003	
334801004	
334801005	
334801006	
334801007	
334801008	
334801009	
334801010	Such conduct ill befits a warrior.
334802000	I see. You are but a simple villain.
334802001	
334802002	
334802003	
334802004	
334802005	
334802006	
334802007	
334802008	
334802009	
334802010	Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!
334803000	You wouldn't even register as a threat to father.
334803001	
334803002	
334803003	
334803004	
334803005	
334803006	
334803007	
334803008	
334803009	
334803010	Hurry up and die.
334804000	Father... I am slain.
334804001	
334804002	
334804003	
334804004	
334804005	
334804006	
334804007	
334804008	
334804009	
334804010	Please...become Elden Lord...
334900000	 
334900001	
334900002	
334900003	
334900004	
334900005	
334900006	
334900007	
334900008	
334900009	
334900010	 
334900011	
334900012	
334900013	
334900014	
334900015	
334900016	
334900017	
334900018	
334900019	
334900020	 
335001000	Hm.
335001001	
335001002	
335001003	
335001004	
335001005	
335001006	
335001007	
335001008	
335001009	
335001010	A new face, are you?
335001011	
335001012	
335001013	
335001014	
335001015	
335001016	
335001017	
335001018	
335001019	
335001020	Well, while you're here. Have you, too, been seduced by the good lady alcohol?
335001021	
335001022	
335001023	
335001024	
335001025	
335001026	
335001027	
335001028	
335001029	
335001030	Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?
335001031	
335001032	
335001033	
335001034	
335001035	
335001036	
335001037	
335001038	
335001039	
335001040	Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.
335001041	
335001042	
335001043	
335001044	
335001045	
335001046	
335001047	
335001048	
335001049	
335001050	And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,
335001051	
335001052	
335001053	
335001054	
335001055	
335001056	
335001057	
335001058	
335001059	
335001060	I'd gladly share some with you.
335001061	
335001062	
335001063	
335001064	
335001065	
335001066	
335001067	
335001068	
335001069	
335001070	The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished.
335001071	
335001072	
335001073	
335001074	
335001075	
335001076	
335001077	
335001078	
335001079	
335001080	And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield...
335002000	You'll help me then?
335002001	
335002002	
335002003	
335002004	
335002005	
335002006	
335002007	
335002008	
335002009	
335002010	Wonderful! Music to my ears.
335002011	
335002012	
335002013	
335002014	
335002015	
335002016	
335002017	
335002018	
335002019	
335002020	Then take this with you.
335002021	
335002022	
335002023	
335002024	
335002025	
335002026	
335002027	
335002028	
335002029	
335002030	That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball.
335002031	
335002032	
335002033	
335002034	
335002035	
335002036	
335002037	
335002038	
335002039	
335002040	It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep,
335002041	
335002042	
335002043	
335002044	
335002045	
335002046	
335002047	
335002048	
335002049	
335002050	those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken.
335002051	
335002052	
335002053	
335002054	
335002055	
335002056	
335002057	
335002058	
335002059	
335002060	Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog.
335003000	Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer.
335003001	
335003002	
335003003	
335003004	
335003005	
335003006	
335003007	
335003008	
335003009	
335003010	About two should do it, by my reckoning...
335003011	
335003012	
335003013	
335003014	
335003015	
335003016	
335003017	
335003018	
335003019	
335003020	About three should do it, by my reckoning...
335003021	
335003022	
335003023	
335003024	
335003025	
335003026	
335003027	
335003028	
335003029	
335003030	About four should do it, by my reckoning...
335003031	
335003032	
335003033	
335003034	
335003035	
335003036	
335003037	
335003038	
335003039	
335003040	About five should do it, by my reckoning...
335003041	
335003042	
335003043	
335003044	
335003045	
335003046	
335003047	
335003048	
335003049	
335003050	About six should do it, by my reckoning...
335003051	
335003052	
335003053	
335003054	
335003055	
335003056	
335003057	
335003058	
335003059	
335003060	And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share.
335003061	
335003062	
335003063	
335003064	
335003065	
335003066	
335003067	
335003068	
335003069	
335003070	Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand; this world's delights, and its futility.
335004000	You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on.
335004001	
335004002	
335004003	
335004004	
335004005	
335004006	
335004007	
335004008	
335004009	
335004010	Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long.
335004011	
335004012	
335004013	
335004014	
335004015	
335004016	
335004017	
335004018	
335004019	
335004020	Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world...
335004021	
335004022	
335004023	
335004024	
335004025	
335004026	
335004027	
335004028	
335004029	
335004030	Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets...
335005000	What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all?
335005001	
335005002	
335005003	
335005004	
335005005	
335005006	
335005007	
335005008	
335005009	
335005010	Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?
335005011	
335005012	
335005013	
335005014	
335005015	
335005016	
335005017	
335005018	
335005019	
335005020	Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.
335005021	
335005022	
335005023	
335005024	
335005025	
335005026	
335005027	
335005028	
335005029	
335005030	And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,
335005031	
335005032	
335005033	
335005034	
335005035	
335005036	
335005037	
335005038	
335005039	
335005040	I'd gladly share some with you.
335005041	
335005042	
335005043	
335005044	
335005045	
335005046	
335005047	
335005048	
335005049	
335005050	What do you say?
335010000	Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return.
335010001	
335010002	
335010003	
335010004	
335010005	
335010006	
335010007	
335010008	
335010009	
335010010	How did you fare? Find any slumber fog?
335011000	Hmm, not quite enough.
335011001	
335011002	
335011003	
335011004	
335011005	
335011006	
335011007	
335011008	
335011009	
335011010	As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
335011011	
335011012	
335011013	
335011014	
335011015	
335011016	
335011017	
335011018	
335011019	
335011020	As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need three doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
335011021	
335011022	
335011023	
335011024	
335011025	
335011026	
335011027	
335011028	
335011029	
335011030	As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need four doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
335011031	
335011032	
335011033	
335011034	
335011035	
335011036	
335011037	
335011038	
335011039	
335011040	As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need five doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
335011041	
335011042	
335011043	
335011044	
335011045	
335011046	
335011047	
335011048	
335011049	
335011050	As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need six doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
335012000	I see, I see. You have what I asked.
335012001	
335012002	
335012003	
335012004	
335012005	
335012006	
335012007	
335012008	
335012009	
335012010	All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm.
335012011	
335012012	
335012013	
335012014	
335012015	
335012016	
335012017	
335012018	
335012019	
335012020	Good work, my compeer.
335012021	
335012022	
335012023	
335012024	
335012025	
335012026	
335012027	
335012028	
335012029	
335012030	Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours.
335013000	Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer.
335013001	
335013002	
335013003	
335013004	
335013005	
335013006	
335013007	
335013008	
335013009	
335013010	Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it.
335014000	Allow me a little advice, my compeer.
335014001	
335014002	
335014003	
335014004	
335014005	
335014006	
335014007	
335014008	
335014009	
335014010	Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight.
335014011	
335014012	
335014013	
335014014	
335014015	
335014016	
335014017	
335014018	
335014019	
335014020	If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures,
335014021	
335014022	
335014023	
335014024	
335014025	
335014026	
335014027	
335014028	
335014029	
335014030	Then treat them to some dreambrew.
335014031	
335014032	
335014033	
335014034	
335014035	
335014036	
335014037	
335014038	
335014039	
335014040	Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour...
335014041	
335014042	
335014043	
335014044	
335014045	
335014046	
335014047	
335014048	
335014049	
335014050	Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue...
335015000	Did you forget something?
335016000	Oh, hello there.
335016001	
335016002	
335016003	
335016004	
335016005	
335016006	
335016007	
335016008	
335016009	
335016010	Have you brought me some more slumber fog?
335017000	You certainly have a taste for spirits.
335017001	
335017002	
335017003	
335017004	
335017005	
335017006	
335017007	
335017008	
335017009	
335017010	I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you.
335018000	...
335019000	...
335019001	
335019002	
335019003	
335019004	
335019005	
335019006	
335019007	
335019008	
335019009	
335019010	...
335020000	As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth.
335020001	
335020002	
335020003	
335020004	
335020005	
335020006	
335020007	
335020008	
335020009	
335020010	And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship.
335020011	
335020012	
335020013	
335020014	
335020015	
335020016	
335020017	
335020018	
335020019	
335020020	Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men.
335030000	Ah, good to see you.
335030001	
335030002	
335030003	
335030004	
335030005	
335030006	
335030007	
335030008	
335030009	
335030010	I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened.
335030011	
335030012	
335030013	
335030014	
335030015	
335030016	
335030017	
335030018	
335030019	
335030020	So I forced these old bones to weather the journey.
335030021	
335030022	
335030023	
335030024	
335030025	
335030026	
335030027	
335030028	
335030029	
335030030	Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage?
335030031	
335030032	
335030033	
335030034	
335030035	
335030036	
335030037	
335030038	
335030039	
335030040	Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh.
335030041	
335030042	
335030043	
335030044	
335030045	
335030046	
335030047	
335030048	
335030049	
335030050	But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles...
335031000	Did you need something else?
335032000	Oh it's, good, good to see you.
335032001	
335032002	
335032003	
335032004	
335032005	
335032006	
335032007	
335032008	
335032009	
335032010	I think I was about to freeze solid.
335033000	...
335034000	...
335034001	
335034002	
335034003	
335034004	
335034005	
335034006	
335034007	
335034008	
335034009	
335034010	...
335040000	You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.
335040001	
335040002	
335040003	
335040004	
335040005	
335040006	
335040007	
335040008	
335040009	
335040010	Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.
335040011	
335040012	
335040013	
335040014	
335040015	
335040016	
335040017	
335040018	
335040019	
335040020	The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.
335040021	
335040022	
335040023	
335040024	
335040025	
335040026	
335040027	
335040028	
335040029	
335040030	Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling...
335040031	
335040032	
335040033	
335040034	
335040035	
335040036	
335040037	
335040038	
335040039	
335040040	Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth,
335040041	
335040042	
335040043	
335040044	
335040045	
335040046	
335040047	
335040048	
335040049	
335040050	each of us has our secrets, my compeer.
335041000	You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.
335041001	
335041002	
335041003	
335041004	
335041005	
335041006	
335041007	
335041008	
335041009	
335041010	Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.
335041011	
335041012	
335041013	
335041014	
335041015	
335041016	
335041017	
335041018	
335041019	
335041020	The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.
335050000	Finally, I have found it!
335050001	
335050002	
335050003	
335050004	
335050005	
335050006	
335050007	
335050008	
335050009	
335050010	St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver.
335050011	
335050012	
335050013	
335050014	
335050015	
335050016	
335050017	
335050018	
335050019	
335050020	I have partaken of untold secrets.
335050021	
335050022	
335050023	
335050024	
335050025	
335050026	
335050027	
335050028	
335050029	
335050030	Such that I might aid you, O Lord.
335050031	
335050032	
335050033	
335050034	
335050035	
335050036	
335050037	
335050038	
335050039	
335050040	So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,
335050041	
335050042	
335050043	
335050044	
335050045	
335050046	
335050047	
335050048	
335050049	
335050050	Into your dream, the world of your heart.
335050051	
335050052	
335050053	
335050054	
335050055	
335050056	
335050057	
335050058	
335050059	
335050060	Indeed, I beg you grant my wish,
335050061	
335050062	
335050063	
335050064	
335050065	
335050066	
335050067	
335050068	
335050069	
335050070	That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side.
335051000	I have partaken of untold secrets.
335051001	
335051002	
335051003	
335051004	
335051005	
335051006	
335051007	
335051008	
335051009	
335051010	Such that I might aid you, O Lord.
335051011	
335051012	
335051013	
335051014	
335051015	
335051016	
335051017	
335051018	
335051019	
335051020	So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,
335051021	
335051022	
335051023	
335051024	
335051025	
335051026	
335051027	
335051028	
335051029	
335051030	Into your dream, the world of your heart.
335060000	...
335100000	Oh ho, are you asking me to partake?
335100001	
335100002	
335100003	
335100004	
335100005	
335100006	
335100007	
335100008	
335100009	
335100010	Well, I haven't got a clue what to think.
335100011	
335100012	
335100013	
335100014	
335100015	
335100016	
335100017	
335100018	
335100019	
335100020	Is this outright impudence? Simple callousness? Or genuine kindness, I wonder?
335100021	
335100022	
335100023	
335100024	
335100025	
335100026	
335100027	
335100028	
335100029	
335100030	...
335100031	
335100032	
335100033	
335100034	
335100035	
335100036	
335100037	
335100038	
335100039	
335100040	Well, what matters it? I'll take some, regardless.
335100041	
335100042	
335100043	
335100044	
335100045	
335100046	
335100047	
335100048	
335100049	
335100050	You couldn't possibly fathom the secrets I possess, my compeer.
335101000	...
335800000	...
335800001	
335800002	
335800003	
335800004	
335800005	
335800006	
335800007	
335800008	
335800009	
335800010	Have you lost your marbles?
335800011	
335800012	
335800013	
335800014	
335800015	
335800016	
335800017	
335800018	
335800019	
335800020	You do know I'm merely a beggar.
335800021	
335800022	
335800023	
335800024	
335800025	
335800026	
335800027	
335800028	
335800029	
335800030	I've nothing left to give.
335801000	Haven't you Tarnished any respect?
335801001	
335801002	
335801003	
335801004	
335801005	
335801006	
335801007	
335801008	
335801009	
335801010	For those who came before you.
335802000	Well, that knocked the wind out of me.
335802001	
335802002	
335802003	
335802004	
335802005	
335802006	
335802007	
335802008	
335802009	
335802010	The perfect time to try that special reserve…
335803000	You base, facile, uncharitable bastard…
335803001	
335803002	
335803003	
335803004	
335803005	
335803006	
335803007	
335803008	
335803009	
335803010	You're beyond help, my compeer…
335900000	 
335900001	
335900002	
335900003	
335900004	
335900005	
335900006	
335900007	
335900008	
335900009	
335900010	 
335900011	
335900012	
335900013	
335900014	
335900015	
335900016	
335900017	
335900018	
335900019	
335900020	 
335900021	
335900022	
335900023	
335900024	
335900025	
335900026	
335900027	
335900028	
335900029	
335900030	 
337001000	Welcome, dear guest.
337001001	
337001002	
337001003	
337001004	
337001005	
337001006	
337001007	
337001008	
337001009	
337001010	After being out there, it must be quite surprising,
337001011	
337001012	
337001013	
337001014	
337001015	
337001016	
337001017	
337001018	
337001019	
337001020	to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace.
337001021	
337001022	
337001023	
337001024	
337001025	
337001026	
337001027	
337001028	
337001029	
337001030	The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal.
337002000	Oh?
337002001	
337002002	
337002003	
337002004	
337002005	
337002006	
337002007	
337002008	
337002009	
337002010	I didn't notice that you were Tarnished.
337002011	
337002012	
337002013	
337002014	
337002015	
337002016	
337002017	
337002018	
337002019	
337002020	...
337002021	
337002022	
337002023	
337002024	
337002025	
337002026	
337002027	
337002028	
337002029	
337002030	Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way.
337002031	
337002032	
337002033	
337002034	
337002035	
337002036	
337002037	
337002038	
337002039	
337002040	But you must leave the capital at once.
337003000	It is for your own good, I assure you.
337003001	
337003002	
337003003	
337003004	
337003005	
337003006	
337003007	
337003008	
337003009	
337003010	All things have their proper place.
337003011	
337003012	
337003013	
337003014	
337003015	
337003016	
337003017	
337003018	
337003019	
337003020	We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital.
337003021	
337003022	
337003023	
337003024	
337003025	
337003026	
337003027	
337003028	
337003029	
337003030	You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.
337003031	
337003032	
337003033	
337003034	
337003035	
337003036	
337003037	
337003038	
337003039	
337003040	So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.
337003041	
337003042	
337003043	
337003044	
337003045	
337003046	
337003047	
337003048	
337003049	
337003050	The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.
337003051	
337003052	
337003053	
337003054	
337003055	
337003056	
337003057	
337003058	
337003059	
337003060	Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.
337003061	
337003062	
337003063	
337003064	
337003065	
337003066	
337003067	
337003068	
337003069	
337003070	But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!
337003071	
337003072	
337003073	
337003074	
337003075	
337003076	
337003077	
337003078	
337003079	
337003080	Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,
337003081	
337003082	
337003083	
337003084	
337003085	
337003086	
337003087	
337003088	
337003089	
337003090	the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!
337003091	
337003092	
337003093	
337003094	
337003095	
337003096	
337003097	
337003098	
337003099	
337003100	The lesson here is self-evident.
337003101	
337003102	
337003103	
337003104	
337003105	
337003106	
337003107	
337003108	
337003109	
337003110	The capital is simply not where you belong.
337004000	You mustn't take it the wrong way.
337004001	
337004002	
337004003	
337004004	
337004005	
337004006	
337004007	
337004008	
337004009	
337004010	But you must leave the capital at once.
337010000	Well, what have we here...
337010001	
337010002	
337010003	
337010004	
337010005	
337010006	
337010007	
337010008	
337010009	
337010010	You hunt Omen, do you?
337010011	
337010012	
337010013	
337010014	
337010015	
337010016	
337010017	
337010018	
337010019	
337010020	Mm-hmm, yes it appears so...
337010021	
337010022	
337010023	
337010024	
337010025	
337010026	
337010027	
337010028	
337010029	
337010030	Well, then perhaps we can talk.
337010031	
337010032	
337010033	
337010034	
337010035	
337010036	
337010037	
337010038	
337010039	
337010040	For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly.
337010041	
337010042	
337010043	
337010044	
337010045	
337010046	
337010047	
337010048	
337010049	
337010050	Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.
337010051	
337010052	
337010053	
337010054	
337010055	
337010056	
337010057	
337010058	
337010059	
337010060	And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.
337010061	
337010062	
337010063	
337010064	
337010065	
337010066	
337010067	
337010068	
337010069	
337010070	The Undercapital is a repository of waste.
337010071	
337010072	
337010073	
337010074	
337010075	
337010076	
337010077	
337010078	
337010079	
337010080	For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.
337010081	
337010082	
337010083	
337010084	
337010085	
337010086	
337010087	
337010088	
337010089	
337010090	And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.
337010091	
337010092	
337010093	
337010094	
337010095	
337010096	
337010097	
337010098	
337010099	
337010100	A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity.
337011000	Get on with it, then.
337011001	
337011002	
337011003	
337011004	
337011005	
337011006	
337011007	
337011008	
337011009	
337011010	Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.
337011011	
337011012	
337011013	
337011014	
337011015	
337011016	
337011017	
337011018	
337011019	
337011020	I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight.
337020000	Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?
337020001	
337020002	
337020003	
337020004	
337020005	
337020006	
337020007	
337020008	
337020009	
337020010	Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.
337020011	
337020012	
337020013	
337020014	
337020015	
337020016	
337020017	
337020018	
337020019	
337020020	I forgive you.
337020021	
337020022	
337020023	
337020024	
337020025	
337020026	
337020027	
337020028	
337020029	
337020030	We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble.
337021000	Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?
337021001	
337021002	
337021003	
337021004	
337021005	
337021006	
337021007	
337021008	
337021009	
337021010	That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad.
337030000	Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.
337030001	
337030002	
337030003	
337030004	
337030005	
337030006	
337030007	
337030008	
337030009	
337030010	You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.
337030011	
337030012	
337030013	
337030014	
337030015	
337030016	
337030017	
337030018	
337030019	
337030020	Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.
337030021	
337030022	
337030023	
337030024	
337030025	
337030026	
337030027	
337030028	
337030029	
337030030	Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.
337030031	
337030032	
337030033	
337030034	
337030035	
337030036	
337030037	
337030038	
337030039	
337030040	The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.
337030041	
337030042	
337030043	
337030044	
337030045	
337030046	
337030047	
337030048	
337030049	
337030050	No, this is above their station...
337030051	
337030052	
337030053	
337030054	
337030055	
337030056	
337030057	
337030058	
337030059	
337030060	If I explained that this was all my idea,
337030061	
337030062	
337030063	
337030064	
337030065	
337030066	
337030067	
337030068	
337030069	
337030070	I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.
337030071	
337030072	
337030073	
337030074	
337030075	
337030076	
337030077	
337030078	
337030079	
337030080	What a wondrous opportunity.
337030081	
337030082	
337030083	
337030084	
337030085	
337030086	
337030087	
337030088	
337030089	
337030090	That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.
337030091	
337030092	
337030093	
337030094	
337030095	
337030096	
337030097	
337030098	
337030099	
337030100	Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights.
337031000	Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.
337031001	
337031002	
337031003	
337031004	
337031005	
337031006	
337031007	
337031008	
337031009	
337031010	This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.
337031011	
337031012	
337031013	
337031014	
337031015	
337031016	
337031017	
337031018	
337031019	
337031020	It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request.
337032000	I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...
337032001	
337032002	
337032003	
337032004	
337032005	
337032006	
337032007	
337032008	
337032009	
337032010	For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory.
337033000	Now, I need to get myself ready.
337033001	
337033002	
337033003	
337033004	
337033005	
337033006	
337033007	
337033008	
337033009	
337033010	If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,
337033011	
337033012	
337033013	
337033014	
337033015	
337033016	
337033017	
337033018	
337033019	
337033020	I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best.
337040000	Kill our lord...
337040001	
337040002	
337040003	
337040004	
337040005	
337040006	
337040007	
337040008	
337040009	
337040010	He is a stain upon all things golden...

348002001	
348002002	
348002003	
348002004	
348002005	
348002006	
348002007	
348002008	
348002009	
348002010	Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.
348002011	
348002012	
348002013	
348002014

348002016	
348002017	
348002018	
348002019	
348002020	My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.
348002021	
348002022	
348002023	
348002024	
348002025	
348002026	
348002027	
348002028	
348002029	
348002030	It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.

348002034

348003006	
348003007	
348003008	
348003009	
348003010	My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.
348010000	You ask that I stab myself with the needle...
348010001	
348010002	
348010003	
348010004	
348010005	
348010006	
348010007	
348010008	
348010009	
348010010	To quell the scarlet rot?
348010011	
348010012	
348010013	
348010014	
348010015	
348010016	
348010017	
348010018	
348010019	
348010020	But...how?
348010021	
348010022	
348010023	
348010024	
348010025	
348010026	
348010027	
348010028	
348010029	
348010030	...
348010031	
348010032	
348010033	
348010034	
348010035	
348010036	
348010037	
348010038	
348010039	
348010040	Never mind. I've decided.
348010041	
348010042	
348010043	
348010044	
348010045	
348010046	
348010047	
348010048	
348010049	
348010050	I would rather trust you,
348010051	
348010052	
348010053	
348010054	
348010055	
348010056	
348010057	
348010058	
348010059	
348010060	than simply continue to spoil from within.
348011000	Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment?
348011001	
348011002	
348011003	
348011004	
348011005	
348011006	
348011007	
348011008	
348011009	
348011010	
348011050	Well. That was easier than expected.
348011051	
348011052	
348011053	
348011054	
348011055	
348011056	
348011057	
348011058	
348011059	
348011060	But...why do I feel so...
348011061	
348011062	
348011063	
348011064	
348011065	
348011066	
348011067	
348011068	
348011069	
348011070	...
348012000	...
348020000	I...hoped to see you again.
348020001	
348020002	
348020003	
348020004	
348020005	
348020006	
348020007	
348020008	
348020009	
348020010	My apologies, for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you.
348020011	
348020012	
348020013	
348020014	
348020015	
348020016	
348020017	
348020018	
348020019	
348020020	Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe.
348020021	
348020022	
348020023	
348020024	
348020025	
348020026	
348020027	
348020028	
348020029	
348020030	Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please.
348020031	
348020032	
348020033	
348020034	
348020035	
348020036	
348020037	
348020038	
348020039	
348020040	Not that I could ever truly repay you,
348020041	
348020042	
348020043	
348020044	
348020045	
348020046	
348020047	
348020048	
348020049	
348020050	but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is.
348021000	I'm considering leaving. On a journey.
348021001	
348021002	
348021003	
348021004	
348021005	
348021006	
348021007	
348021008	
348021009	
348021010	With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...
348021011	
348021012	
348021013	
348021014	
348021015	
348021016	
348021017	
348021018	
348021019	
348021020	My destiny...
348021021	
348021022	
348021023	
348021024	
348021025	
348021026	
348021027	
348021028	
348021029	
348021030	It's all thanks to you.
348021031	
348021032	
348021033	
348021034	
348021035	
348021036	
348021037	
348021038	
348021039	
348021040	My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.
348022000	I'm considering leaving. On a journey.
348022001	
348022002	
348022003	
348022004	
348022005	
348022006	
348022007	
348022008	
348022009	
348022010	With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...
348022011	
348022012	
348022013	
348022014	
348022015	
348022016	
348022017	
348022018	
348022019	
348022020	My destiny...
348025000	Oh, hello again.
348025001	
348025002	
348025003	
348025004	
348025005	
348025006	
348025007	
348025008	
348025009	
348025010	Something about this place felt familiar to me.
348025011	
348025012	
348025013	
348025014	
348025015	
348025016	
348025017	
348025018	
348025019	
348025020	So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here.
348025021	
348025022	
348025023	
348025024	
348025025	
348025026	
348025027	
348025028	
348025029	
348025030	But I've only found emptiness.
348025031	
348025032	
348025033	
348025034	
348025035	
348025036	
348025037	
348025038	
348025039	
348025040	Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to.
348026000	Well, never mind that.
348026001	
348026002	
348026003	
348026004	
348026005	
348026006	
348026007	
348026008	
348026009	
348026010	I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.
348026011	
348026012	
348026013	
348026014	
348026015	
348026016	
348026017	
348026018	
348026019	
348026020	I must stay strong.
348030000	Ah. We meet again.
348030001	
348030002	
348030003	
348030004	
348030005	
348030006	
348030007	
348030008	
348030009	
348030010	In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me.
348030011	
348030012	
348030013	
348030014	
348030015	
348030016	
348030017	
348030018	
348030019	
348030020	The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met.
348030021	
348030022	
348030023	
348030024	
348030025	
348030026	
348030027	
348030028	
348030029	
348030030	As such, I've been able to continue my journey.
348030031	
348030032	
348030033	
348030034	
348030035	
348030036	
348030037	
348030038	
348030039	
348030040	Though rather vexingly,
348030041	
348030042	
348030043	
348030044	
348030045	
348030046	
348030047	
348030048	
348030049	
348030050	I realise that if I still had my sword arm,
348030051	
348030052	
348030053	
348030054	
348030055	
348030056	
348030057	
348030058	
348030059	
348030060	I could have aided you in battle.
348031000	Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took,
348031001	
348031002	
348031003	
348031004	
348031005	
348031006	
348031007	
348031008	
348031009	
348031010	after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds.
348031011	
348031012	
348031013	
348031014	
348031015	
348031016	
348031017	
348031018	
348031019	
348031020	I should like to meet her, this vanished woman.
348031021	
348031022	
348031023	
348031024	
348031025	
348031026	
348031027	
348031028	
348031029	
348031030	I think she's in the north.
348031031	
348031032	
348031033	
348031034	
348031035	
348031036	
348031037	
348031038	
348031039	
348031040	In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.
348032000	Are you...
348032001	
348032002	
348032003	
348032004	
348032005	
348032006	
348032007	
348032008	
348032009	
348032010	Giving me this arm?
348032011	
348032012	
348032013	
348032014	
348032015	
348032016	
348032017	
348032018	
348032019	
348032020	I thank you.
348032021	
348032022	
348032023	
348032024	
348032025	
348032026	
348032027	
348032028	
348032029	
348032030	I am in your debt, yet again.
348032031	
348032032	
348032033	
348032034	
348032035	
348032036	
348032037	
348032038	
348032039	
348032040	I think, If the arm serves well enough,
348032041	
348032042	
348032043	
348032044	
348032045	
348032046	
348032047	
348032048	
348032049	
348032050	It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.
348033000	If the arm serves well enough,
348033001	
348033002	
348033003	
348033004	
348033005	
348033006	
348033007	
348033008	
348033009	
348033010	It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.
348033011	
348033012	
348033013	
348033014	
348033015	
348033016	
348033017	
348033018	
348033019	
348033020	Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle.
348035000	Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took.
348035001	
348035002	
348035003	
348035004	
348035005	
348035006	
348035007	
348035008	
348035009	
348035010	She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.
348040000	Ah, we meet yet again.
348040001	
348040002	
348040003	
348040004	
348040005	
348040006	
348040007	
348040008	
348040009	
348040010	The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.
348040011	
348040012	
348040013	
348040014	
348040015	
348040016	
348040017	
348040018	
348040019	
348040020	It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.
348040021	
348040022	
348040023	
348040024	
348040025	
348040026	
348040027	
348040028	
348040029	
348040030	Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.
348040031	
348040032	
348040033	
348040034	
348040035	
348040036	
348040037	
348040038	
348040039	
348040040	Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need.
348041000	Ah, we meet yet again.
348041001	
348041002	
348041003	
348041004	
348041005	
348041006	
348041007	
348041008	
348041009	
348041010	The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.
348041011	
348041012	
348041013	
348041014	
348041015	
348041016	
348041017	
348041018	
348041019	
348041020	It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.
348041021	
348041022	
348041023	
348041024	
348041025	
348041026	
348041027	
348041028	
348041029	
348041030	Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.
348041031	
348041032	
348041033	
348041034	
348041035	
348041036	
348041037	
348041038	
348041039	
348041040	Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.
348042000	I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.
348042001	
348042002	
348042003	
348042004	
348042005	
348042006	
348042007	
348042008	
348042009	
348042010	It is the only way that I can express my thanks.
348050000	To think we'd meet in such a place...
348050001	
348050002	
348050003	
348050004	
348050005	
348050006	
348050007	
348050008	
348050009	
348050010	What could your purpose possibly...
348050011	
348050012	
348050013	
348050014	
348050015	
348050016	
348050017	
348050018	
348050019	
348050020	No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me.
348050021	
348050022	
348050023	
348050024	
348050025	
348050026	
348050027	
348050028	
348050029	
348050030	Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.
348051000	I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.
348051001	
348051002	
348051003	
348051004	
348051005	
348051006	
348051007	
348051008	
348051009	
348051010	I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.
348051011	
348051012	
348051013	
348051014	
348051015	
348051016	
348051017	
348051018	
348051019	
348051020	I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.
348051021	
348051022	
348051023	
348051024	
348051025	
348051026	
348051027	
348051028	
348051029	
348051030	Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found.
348051031	
348051032	
348051033	
348051034	
348051035	
348051036	
348051037	
348051038	
348051039	
348051040	The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.
348052000	I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.
348052001	
348052002	
348052003	
348052004	
348052005	
348052006	
348052007	
348052008	
348052009	
348052010	I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.
348052011	
348052012	
348052013	
348052014	
348052015	
348052016	
348052017	
348052018	
348052019	
348052020	I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.
348060000	Again we meet.
348060001	
348060002	
348060003	
348060004	
348060005	
348060006	
348060007	
348060008	
348060009	
348060010	I can only surmise our purposes are aligned.
348060011	
348060012	
348060013	
348060014	
348060015	
348060016	
348060017	
348060018	
348060019	
348060020	In which case, allow me to explain myself.
348060021	
348060022	
348060023	
348060024	
348060025	
348060026	
348060027	
348060028	
348060029	
348060030	I am of Malenia's blood.
348060031	
348060032	
348060033	
348060034	
348060035	
348060036	
348060037	
348060038	
348060039	
348060040	But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot…
348060041	
348060042	
348060043	
348060044	
348060045	
348060046	
348060047	
348060048	
348060049	
348060050	Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.
348061000	There is something I must return to Malenia.
348061001	
348061002	
348061003	
348061004	
348061005	
348061006	
348061007	
348061008	
348061009	
348061010	The will that was once her own.
348061011	
348061012	
348061013	
348061014	
348061015	
348061016	
348061017	
348061018	
348061019	
348061020	The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.
348061021	
348061022	
348061023	
348061024	
348061025	
348061026	
348061027	
348061028	
348061029	
348061030	The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.
348062000	There is something I must return to Malenia.
348062001	
348062002	
348062003	
348062004	
348062005	
348062006	
348062007	
348062008	
348062009	
348062010	The will that was once her own.
348062011	
348062012	
348062013	
348062014	
348062015	
348062016	
348062017	
348062018	
348062019	
348062020	The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.
348070000	Oh, hello.
348070001	
348070002	
348070003	
348070004	
348070005	
348070006	
348070007	
348070008	
348070009	
348070010	Thank you for lending your hand.
348070011	
348070012	
348070013	
348070014	
348070015	
348070016	
348070017	
348070018	
348070019	
348070020	Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet.
348070021	
348070022	
348070023	
348070024	
348070025	
348070026	
348070027	
348070028	
348070029	
348070030	I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.
348070031	
348070032	
348070033	
348070034	
348070035	
348070036	
348070037	
348070038	
348070039	
348070040	Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.
348070041	
348070042	
348070043	
348070044	
348070045	
348070046	
348070047	
348070048	
348070049	
348070050	
348070051	
348070052	
348070053	
348070054	
348070055	
348070056	
348070057	
348070058	
348070059	
348070060	
348070061	
348070062	
348070063	
348070064	
348070065	
348070066	
348070067	
348070068	
348070069	
348070070	
348071000	But this is where things end.
348071001	
348071002	
348071003	
348071004	
348071005	
348071006	
348071007	
348071008	
348071009	
348071010	I pause to even tell you, but...
348071011	
348071012	
348071013	
348071014	
348071015	
348071016	
348071017	
348071018	
348071019	
348071020	I took out the needle myself.
348071021	
348071022	
348071023	
348071024	
348071025	
348071026	
348071027	
348071028	
348071029	
348071030	Tell whoever put you up to this.
348071031	
348071032	
348071033	
348071034	
348071035	
348071036	
348071037	
348071038	
348071039	
348071040	That if I am to flower into something other than myself,
348071041	
348071042	
348071043	
348071044	
348071045	
348071046	
348071047	
348071048	
348071049	
348071050	I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.
348072000	Please, let me pass alone.
348072001	
348072002	
348072003	
348072004	
348072005	
348072006	
348072007	
348072008	
348072009	
348072010	The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever.
348072011	
348072012	
348072013	
348072014	
348072015	
348072016	
348072017	
348072018	
348072019	
348072020	Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh.
348072021	
348072022	
348072023	
348072024	
348072025	
348072026	
348072027	
348072028	
348072029	
348072030	Curse-laden. Untouchable.
348072031	
348072032	
348072033	
348072034	
348072035	
348072036	
348072037	
348072038	
348072039	
348072040	I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.
348800000	Ugh.
348801000	Is there something wrong?
348801001	
348801002	
348801003	
348801004	
348801005	
348801006	
348801007	
348801008	
348801009	
348801010	Please, cease this at once.
348802000	Why are you doing this?
348802001	
348802002	
348802003	
348802004	
348802005	
348802006	
348802007	
348802008	
348802009	
348802010	Now you've forced my hand.
348803000	I will not forget what you did for me.
348803001	
348803002	
348803003	
348803004	
348803005	
348803006	
348803007	
348803008	
348803009	
348803010	But this day marks our farewell.
348804000	I did not imagine it ending like this.
348804001	
348804002	
348804003	
348804004	
348804005	
348804006	
348804007	
348804008	
348804009	
348804010	But I will not forget what you have done.
348804011	
348804012	
348804013	
348804014	
348804015	
348804016	
348804017	
348804018	
348804019	
348804020	Thank...you...
348805000	Ahh, how could you...
348805001	
348805002	
348805003	
348805004	
348805005	
348805006	
348805007	
348805008	
348805009	
348805010	Is this your true heart?
348805011	
348805012	
348805013	
348805014	
348805015	
348805016	
348805017	
348805018	
348805019	
348805020	Was I... was it all...for this?
348900000	 
348900100	 
348900200	 
349001000	Oh, a pleasure to see you, a pleasure indeed.
349001001	
349001002	
349001003	
349001004	
349001005	
349001006	
349001007	
349001008	
349001009	
349001010	I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day, anyway.
349001011	
349001012	
349001013	
349001014	
349001015	
349001016	
349001017	
349001018	
349001019	
349001020	I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along.
349001021	
349001022	
349001023	
349001024	
349001025	
349001026	
349001027	
349001028	
349001029	
349001030	A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.
349001031	
349001032	
349001033	
349001034	
349001035	
349001036	
349001037	
349001038	
349001039	
349001040	Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense.
349001041	
349001042	
349001043	
349001044	
349001045	
349001046	
349001047	
349001048	
349001049	
349001050	Should you accept…
349001051	
349001052	
349001053	
349001054	
349001055	
349001056	
349001057	
349001058	
349001059	
349001060	I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there.
349010000	Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you?
349010001	
349010002	
349010003	
349010004	
349010005	
349010006	
349010007	
349010008	
349010009	
349010010	I need your help to heal a certain young girl.
349010011	
349010012	
349010013	
349010014	
349010015	
349010016	
349010017	
349010018	
349010019	
349010020	Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia,
349010021	
349010022	
349010023	
349010024	
349010025	
349010026	
349010027	
349010028	
349010029	
349010030	resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.
349011000	The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure.
349011001	
349011002	
349011003	
349011004	
349011005	
349011006	
349011007	
349011008	
349011009	
349011010	When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.
349011011	
349011012	
349011013	
349011014	
349011015	
349011016	
349011017	
349011018	
349011019	
349011020	But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated.
349011021	
349011022	
349011023	
349011024	
349011025	
349011026	
349011027	
349011028	
349011029	
349011030	For this, you are to find a certain needle.
349011031	
349011032	
349011033	
349011034	
349011035	
349011036	
349011037	
349011038	
349011039	
349011040	Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds.
349011041	
349011042	
349011043	
349011044	
349011045	
349011046	
349011047	
349011048	
349011049	
349011050	The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there.
349012000	First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle.
349012001	
349012002	
349012003	
349012004	
349012005	
349012006	
349012007	
349012008	
349012009	
349012010	It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia.
349012011	
349012012	
349012013	
349012014	
349012015	
349012016	
349012017	
349012018	
349012019	
349012020	Then I will tell you, as promised.
349012021	
349012022	
349012023	
349012024	
349012025	
349012026	
349012027	
349012028	
349012029	
349012030	The secret of the town of Sellia.
349013000	Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I.
349013001	
349013002	
349013003	
349013004	
349013005	
349013006	
349013007	
349013008	
349013009	
349013010	Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting.
349013011	
349013012	
349013013	
349013014	
349013015	
349013016	
349013017	
349013018	
349013019	
349013020	But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be,
349013021	
349013022	
349013023	
349013024	
349013025	
349013026	
349013027	
349013028	
349013029	
349013030	do come and speak with me again.
349013031	
349013032	
349013033	
349013034	
349013035	
349013036	
349013037	
349013038	
349013039	
349013040	I'll wait as long as it takes.
349014000	Ah, changed your mind, have you?
349014001	
349014002	
349014003	
349014004	
349014005	
349014006	
349014007	
349014008	
349014009	
349014010	If you are willing to undertake my request,
349014011	
349014012	
349014013	
349014014	
349014015	
349014016	
349014017	
349014018	
349014019	
349014020	I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder.
349020000	Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle.
349020001	
349020002	
349020003	
349020004	
349020005	
349020006	
349020007	
349020008	
349020009	
349020010	As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here.
349020011	
349020012	
349020013	
349020014	
349020015	
349020016	
349020017	
349020018	
349020019	
349020020	Go on, it's yours.
349020021	
349020022	
349020023	
349020024	
349020025	
349020026	
349020027	
349020028	
349020029	
349020030	Now, let me have a look at the needle.
349020031	
349020032	
349020033	
349020034	
349020035	
349020036	
349020037	
349020038	
349020039	
349020040	Hmm.
349020041	
349020042	
349020043	
349020044	
349020045	
349020046	
349020047	
349020048	
349020049	
349020050	Hmmmm.
349020051	
349020052	
349020053	
349020054	
349020055	
349020056	
349020057	
349020058	
349020059	
349020060	Well, well, this is a marvel indeed.
349020061	
349020062	
349020063	
349020064	
349020065	
349020066	
349020067	
349020068	
349020069	
349020070	The work of a true artisan…a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.
349020071	
349020072	
349020073	
349020074	
349020075	
349020076	
349020077	
349020078	
349020079	
349020080	Can you give me some time with this?
349020081	
349020082	
349020083	
349020084	
349020085	
349020086	
349020087	
349020088	
349020089	
349020090	As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.
349021000	I have awaited your return.
349021001	
349021002	
349021003	
349021004	
349021005	
349021006	
349021007	
349021008	
349021009	
349021010	The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.
349021011	
349021012	
349021013	
349021014	
349021015	
349021016	
349021017	
349021018	
349021019	
349021020	Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?
349021021	
349021022	
349021023	
349021024	
349021025	
349021026	
349021027	
349021028	
349021029	
349021030	I will reward you in kind.
349021031	
349021032	
349021033	
349021034	
349021035	
349021036	
349021037	
349021038	
349021039	
349021040	Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder.
349021041	
349021042	
349021043	
349021044	
349021045	
349021046	
349021047	
349021048	
349021049	
349021050	Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god.
349021051	
349021052	
349021053	
349021054	
349021055	
349021056	
349021057	
349021058	
349021059	
349021060	A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.
349022000	Do you find it peculiar?
349022001	
349022002	
349022003	
349022004	
349022005	
349022006	
349022007	
349022008	
349022009	
349022010	That I would show such concern for the girl.
349022011	
349022012	
349022013	
349022014	
349022015	
349022016	
349022017	
349022018	
349022019	
349022020	Well, I'm the one that found her.
349022021	
349022022	
349022023	
349022024	
349022025	
349022026	
349022027	
349022028	
349022029	
349022030	A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia.
349022031	
349022032	
349022033	
349022034	
349022035	
349022036	
349022037	
349022038	
349022039	
349022040	She is one of my dear daughters.
349022041	
349022042	
349022043	
349022044	
349022045	
349022046	
349022047	
349022048	
349022049	
349022050	But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.
349022051	
349022052	
349022053	
349022054	
349022055	
349022056	
349022057	
349022058	
349022059	
349022060	I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me.
349022061	
349022062	
349022063	
349022064	
349022065	
349022066	
349022067	
349022068	
349022069	
349022070	Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.
349022071	
349022072	
349022073	
349022074	
349022075	
349022076	
349022077	
349022078	
349022079	
349022080	Ha ha ha...
349023000	Can you give me some time with this?
349023001	
349023002	
349023003	
349023004	
349023005	
349023006	
349023007	
349023008	
349023009	
349023010	As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.
349027000	Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent.
349027001	
349027002	
349027003	
349027004	
349027005	
349027006	
349027007	
349027008	
349027009	
349027010	She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia.
349027011	
349027012	
349027013	
349027014	
349027015	
349027016	
349027017	
349027018	
349027019	
349027020	Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course.
349030000	Thank you kindly.
349030001	
349030002	
349030003	
349030004	
349030005	
349030006	
349030007	
349030008	
349030009	
349030010	For giving the needle to Millicent.
349030011	
349030012	
349030013	
349030014	
349030015	
349030016	
349030017	
349030018	
349030019	
349030020	Now she, too, can begin her journey.
349030021	
349030022	
349030023	
349030024	
349030025	
349030026	
349030027	
349030028	
349030029	
349030030	And stare her fate straight in the eye.
349030031	
349030032	
349030033	
349030034	
349030035	
349030036	
349030037	
349030038	
349030039	
349030040	You've been a saint, through and through.
349030041	
349030042	
349030043

349030045	
349030046	
349030047	
349030048	
349030049	
349030050	As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge
349030051	
349030052	
349030053	
349030054	
349030055	
349030056	
349030057	
349030058	
349030059	
349030060	of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal.
349031000	Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.
349031001	
349031002	
349031003	
349031004	
349031005	
349031006	
349031007	
349031008	
349031009	
349031010	Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,
349031011	
349031012	
349031013	
349031014	
349031015	
349031016	
349031017	
349031018	
349031019	
349031020	but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.
349032000	Oh, you noticed, did you?
349032001	
349032002	
349032003	
349032004	
349032005	
349032006	
349032007	
349032008	
349032009	
349032010	Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.
349032011	
349032012	
349032013	
349032014	
349032015	
349032016	
349032017	
349032018	
349032019	
349032020	It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.
349032021	
349032022	
349032023	
349032024	
349032025	
349032026	
349032027	
349032028	
349032029	
349032030	However, she has no need of me, any more.
349032031	
349032032	
349032033	
349032034	
349032035	
349032036	
349032037	
349032038	
349032039	
349032040	No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.
349032041	
349032042	
349032043	
349032044	
349032045	
349032046	
349032047	
349032048	
349032049	
349032050	As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...
349032051	
349032052	
349032053	
349032054	
349032055	
349032056	
349032057	
349032058	
349032059	
349032060	Is to be forgotten.
349035000	Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help?
349036000	Do you...need me for something else?
349040000	So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement…
349040001	
349040002	
349040003	
349040004	
349040005	
349040006	
349040007	
349040008	
349040009	
349040010	This is a wonderful development.
349040011	
349040012	
349040013	
349040014	
349040015	
349040016	
349040017	
349040018	
349040019	
349040020	Thank you for your kindness.
349040021	
349040022	
349040023	
349040024	
349040025	
349040026	
349040027	
349040028	
349040029	
349040030	Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential.
349040031	
349040032	
349040033	
349040034	
349040035	
349040036	
349040037	
349040038	
349040039	
349040040	Like her beautiful mother.
349041000	The girl, Millicent. She is a bud.
349041001	
349041002	
349041003	
349041004	
349041005	
349041006	
349041007	
349041008	
349041009	
349041010	Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence.
349041011	
349041012	
349041013	
349041014	
349041015	
349041016	
349041017	
349041018	
349041019	
349041020	What a wondrous day that will be.
349041021	
349041022	
349041023	
349041024	
349041025	
349041026	
349041027	
349041028	
349041029	
349041030	In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.
349041031	
349041032	
349041033	
349041034	
349041035	
349041036	
349041037	
349041038	
349041039	
349041040	She might very well outshine her sisters.
349050000	Do you have an interest in rot incantations?
349050001	
349050002	
349050003	
349050004	
349050005	
349050006	
349050007	
349050008	
349050009	
349050010	Then you might like to learn something of the history...
349050011	
349050012	
349050013	
349050014	
349050015	
349050016	
349050017	
349050018	
349050019	
349050020	of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.
349051000	Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.
349051001	
349051002	
349051003	
349051004	
349051005	
349051006	
349051007	
349051008	
349051009	
349051010	She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.
349051011	
349051012	
349051013	
349051014	
349051015	
349051016	
349051017	
349051018	
349051019	
349051020	An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.
349051021	
349051022	
349051023	
349051024	
349051025	
349051026	
349051027	
349051028	
349051029	
349051030	In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,
349051031	
349051032	
349051033	
349051034	
349051035	
349051036	
349051037	
349051038	
349051039	
349051040	the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.
349051041	
349051042	
349051043	
349051044	
349051045	
349051046	
349051047	
349051048	
349051049	
349051050	Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.
349051051	
349051052	
349051053	
349051054	
349051055	
349051056	
349051057	
349051058	
349051059	
349051060	And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.
349060000	Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she?
349060001	
349060002	
349060003	
349060004	
349060005	
349060006	
349060007	
349060008	
349060009	
349060010	The words of a true innocent, the dear girl.
349060011	
349060012	
349060013	
349060014	
349060015	
349060016	
349060017	
349060018	
349060019	
349060020	Well, perhaps this is just as it should be.
349060021	
349060022	
349060023	
349060024	
349060025	
349060026	
349060027	
349060028	
349060029	
349060030	Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.
349060031	
349060032	
349060033	
349060034	
349060035	
349060036	
349060037	
349060038	
349060039	
349060040	This is their fate, after all.
349070000	<sobbing>
349071000	Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there.
349071001	
349071002	
349071003	
349071004	
349071005	
349071006	
349071007	
349071008	
349071009	
349071010	Welcome. How may I help you?
349071011	
349071012	
349071013	
349071014	
349071015	
349071016	
349071017	
349071018	
349071019	
349071020	My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that.
349072000	Oh, it's just…
349072001	
349072002	
349072003	
349072004	
349072005	
349072006	
349072007	
349072008	
349072009	
349072010	I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and…
349072011	
349072012	
349072013	
349072014	
349072015	
349072016	
349072017	
349072018	
349072019	
349072020	My eyes began to well...
349072021	
349072022	
349072023	
349072024	
349072025	
349072026	
349072027	
349072028	
349072029	
349072030	She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.
349072031	
349072032	
349072033	
349072034	
349072035	
349072036	
349072037	
349072038	
349072039	
349072040	And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.
349072041	
349072042	
349072043	
349072044	
349072045	
349072046	
349072047	
349072048	
349072049	
349072050	Which is why...
349072051	
349072052	
349072053	
349072054	
349072055	
349072056	
349072057	
349072058	
349072059	
349072060	If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,
349072061	
349072062	
349072063	
349072064	
349072065	
349072066	
349072067	
349072068	
349072069	
349072070	I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.
349072071	
349072072	
349072073	
349072074	
349072075	
349072076	
349072077	
349072078	
349072079	
349072080	It must be done by your hand; no other.
349072081	
349072082	
349072083	
349072084	
349072085	
349072086	
349072087	
349072088	
349072089	
349072090	Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.
349072091	
349072092	
349072093	
349072094	
349072095	
349072096	
349072097	
349072098	
349072099	
349072100	Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.
349072101	
349072102	
349072103	
349072104	
349072105	
349072106	
349072107	
349072108	
349072109	
349072110	When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.
349072111	
349072112	
349072113	
349072114	
349072115	
349072116	
349072117	
349072118	
349072119	
349072120	As a scarlet valkyrie.
349073000	Thus, I have a request of the utmost import.
349073001	
349073002	
349073003	
349073004	
349073005	
349073006	
349073007	
349073008	
349073009	
349073010	I beg you, kill Millicent.
349073011	
349073012	
349073013	
349073014	
349073015	
349073016	
349073017	
349073018	
349073019	
349073020	Before the girl can meet her sisters.
349073021	
349073022	
349073023	
349073024	
349073025	
349073026	
349073027	
349073028	
349073029	
349073030	There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.
349073031	
349073032	
349073033	
349073034	
349073035	
349073036	
349073037	
349073038	
349073039	
349073040	You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.
349073041	
349073042	
349073043	
349073044	
349073045	
349073046	
349073047	
349073048	
349073049	
349073050	Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.
349073051	
349073052	
349073053	
349073054	
349073055	
349073056	
349073057	
349073058	
349073059	
349073060	Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie.
349074000	You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.
349074001	
349074002	
349074003	
349074004	
349074005	
349074006	
349074007	
349074008	
349074009	
349074010	The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?
349074011	
349074012	
349074013	
349074014	
349074015	
349074016	
349074017	
349074018	
349074019	
349074020	I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.
349075000	Welcome, welcome. How may I help you?
349075001	
349075002	
349075003	
349075004	
349075005	
349075006	
349075007	
349075008	
349075009	
349075010	Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters.
349076000	When the time is ripe...
349076001	
349076002	
349076003	
349076004	
349076005	
349076006	
349076007	
349076008	
349076009	
349076010	Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies.
349076011	
349076012	
349076013	
349076014	
349076015	
349076016	
349076017

349112000	<sleeping>
349800000	Owgh!
349801000	Please, enough.

349801007	
349801008	
349801009	
349801010	There is nothing to be gained by persevering.
349802000	So, the lesson remains unlearned.

349802007	
349802008	
349802009	
349802010	Perhaps you've taken one knock to the head too many.
349803000	We shall meet again, you and I.

349803007	
349803008	
349803009	
349803010	There are countless pests to choose from.
349804000	We shall meet again.

349804004

349804007	
349804008	
349804009	
349804010	As many times as it takes. For you to understand.

349900008	
349900009	
349900010	 
351001000	Oh, I see you've just arrived.
351001001	
351001002	
351001003	
351001004	
351001005	
351001006	
351001007	
351001008	
351001009	
351001010	Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.
351001011	
351001012	
351001013	
351001014	
351001015	
351001016	
351001017	
351001018	
351001019	
351001020	I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers,
351001021	
351001022	
351001023	
351001024	
351001025	
351001026	
351001027	
351001028	
351001029	
351001030	and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.
351001031	
351001032	
351001033	
351001034	
351001035	
351001036	
351001037	
351001038	
351001039	
351001040	So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,
351001041	
351001042	
351001043	
351001044	
351001045	
351001046	
351001047	
351001048	
351001049	
351001050	ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.
351001051	
351001052	
351001053	
351001054	
351001055	
351001056	
351001057	
351001058	
351001059	
351001060	By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.
351002000	You do! Wonderful news.
351002001	
351002002	
351002003	
351002004	
351002005	
351002006	
351002007	
351002008	
351002009	
351002010	Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.
351002011	
351002012	
351002013	
351002014	
351002015	
351002016	
351002017	
351002018	
351002019	
351002020	You are something of a rare breed.
351002021	
351002022	
351002023	
351002024	
351002025	
351002026	
351002027	
351002028	
351002029	
351002030	Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?
351003000	Ah, well, that is unfortunate.
351003001	
351003002	
351003003	
351003004	
351003005	
351003006	
351003007	
351003008	
351003009	
351003010	But no cause for despair.
351003011	
351003012	
351003013	
351003014	
351003015	
351003016	
351003017	
351003018	
351003019	
351003020	It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time.
351003021	
351003022	
351003023	
351003024	
351003025	
351003026	
351003027	
351003028	
351003029	
351003030	Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.
351003031	
351003032	
351003033	
351003034	
351003035	
351003036	
351003037	
351003038	
351003039	
351003040	I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.
351004000	What is it?
351004001	
351004002	
351004003	
351004004	
351004005	
351004006	
351004007	
351004008	
351004009	
351004010	Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision?
351005000	Ah, I see.
351005001	
351005002	
351005003	
351005004	
351005005	
351005006	
351005007	
351005008	
351005009	
351005010	Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.
351005011	
351005012	
351005013	
351005014	
351005015	
351005016	
351005017	
351005018	
351005019	
351005020	I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.
351010000	Further study of incantations, is it?
351010001	
351010002	
351010003	
351010004	
351010005	
351010006	
351010007	
351010008	
351010009	
351010010	I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm.
351011000	Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.
351011001	
351011002	
351011003	
351011004	
351011005	
351011006	
351011007	
351011008	
351011009	
351011010	Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?
351012000	May the Golden Order shine through you.
351015000	There's something I should mention to you, as well.
351015001	
351015002	
351015003	
351015004	
351015005	
351015006	
351015007	
351015008	
351015009	
351015010	I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold.
351015011	
351015012	
351015013	
351015014	
351015015	
351015016	
351015017	
351015018	
351015019	
351015020	Do you know of the noble Goldmask?
351015021	
351015022	
351015023	
351015024	
351015025	
351015026	
351015027	
351015028	
351015029	
351015030	Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between,
351015031	
351015032	
351015033	
351015034	
351015035	
351015036	
351015037	
351015038	
351015039	
351015040	he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace.
351015041	
351015042	
351015043	
351015044	
351015045	
351015046	
351015047	
351015048	
351015049	
351015050	And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...
351015051	
351015052	
351015053	
351015054	
351015055	
351015056	
351015057	
351015058	
351015059	
351015060	I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research.
351020000	Ah, I had been waiting for your return.
351020001	
351020002	
351020003	
351020004	
351020005	
351020006	
351020007	
351020008	
351020009	
351020010	I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all.
351020011	
351020012	
351020013	
351020014	
351020015	
351020016	
351020017	
351020018	
351020019	
351020020	As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask.
351020021	
351020022	
351020023	
351020024	
351020025	
351020026	
351020027	
351020028	
351020029	
351020030	We may not meet again for some time.
351020031	
351020032	
351020033	
351020034	
351020035	
351020036	
351020037	
351020038	
351020039	
351020040	If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.
351021000	Ah, I had been waiting for your return.
351021001	
351021002	
351021003	
351021004	
351021005	
351021006	
351021007	
351021008	
351021009	
351021010	I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold.
351021011	
351021012	
351021013	
351021014	
351021015	
351021016	
351021017	
351021018	
351021019	
351021020	I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction.
351021021	
351021022	
351021023	
351021024	
351021025	
351021026	
351021027	
351021028	
351021029	
351021030	We may not meet again for some time.
351021031	
351021032	
351021033	
351021034	
351021035	
351021036	
351021037	
351021038	
351021039	
351021040	If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.
351030000	Ah, look who we have here.
351030001	
351030002	
351030003	
351030004	
351030005	
351030006	
351030007	
351030008	
351030009	
351030010	How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold.
351030011	
351030012	
351030013	
351030014	
351030015	
351030016	
351030017	
351030018	
351030019	
351030020	I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually.
351030021	
351030022	
351030023	
351030024	
351030025	
351030026	
351030027	
351030028	
351030029	
351030030	And will happily pass it along to you.
351035000	I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask.
351035001	
351035002	
351035003	
351035004	
351035005	
351035006	
351035007	
351035008	
351035009	
351035010	I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree.
351035011	
351035012	
351035013	
351035014	
351035015	
351035016	
351035017	
351035018	
351035019	
351035020	The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall.
351035021	
351035022	
351035023	
351035024	
351035025	
351035026	
351035027	
351035028	
351035029	
351035030	Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,
351035031	
351035032	
351035033	
351035034	
351035035	
351035036	
351035037	
351035038	
351035039	
351035040	How little it is I truly know...
351036000	Do...do you sport with me!?
351036001	
351036002	
351036003	
351036004	
351036005	
351036006	
351036007	
351036008	
351036009	
351036010	From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!
351036011	
351036012	
351036013	
351036014	
351036015	
351036016	
351036017	
351036018	
351036019	
351036020	Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by.
351036021	
351036022	
351036023	
351036024	
351036025	
351036026	
351036027	
351036028	
351036029	
351036030	Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays.
351036031	
351036032	
351036033	
351036034	
351036035	
351036036	
351036037	
351036038	
351036039	
351036040	And to you too. My sincerest thanks.
351037000	I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask.
351037001	
351037002	
351037003	
351037004	
351037005	
351037006	
351037007	
351037008	
351037009	
351037010	It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude.
351040000	Ah, we meet yet again.
351040001	
351040002	
351040003	
351040004	
351040005	
351040006	
351040007	
351040008	
351040009	
351040010	Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,
351040011	
351040012	
351040013	
351040014	
351040015	
351040016	
351040017	
351040018	
351040019	
351040020	and taken my place by his side, as you can see.
351040021	
351040022	
351040023	
351040024	
351040025	
351040026	
351040027	
351040028	
351040029	
351040030	Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before.
351040031	
351040032	
351040033	
351040034	
351040035	
351040036	
351040037	
351040038	
351040039	
351040040	Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation.
351041000	Further study of incantations, is it?
351041001	
351041002	
351041003	
351041004	
351041005	
351041006	
351041007	
351041008	
351041009	
351041010	Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm.
351042000	Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.
351042001	
351042002	
351042003	
351042004	
351042005	
351042006	
351042007	
351042008	
351042009	
351042010	Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?
351043000	May the Golden Order shine through you.
351045000	The master is always deep in contemplation.
351045001	
351045002	
351045003	
351045004	
351045005	
351045006	
351045007	
351045008	
351045009	
351045010	While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger.
351045011	
351045012	
351045013	
351045014	
351045015	
351045016	
351045017	
351045018	
351045019	
351045020	And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom...
351045021	
351045022	
351045023	
351045024	
351045025	
351045026	
351045027	
351045028	
351045029	
351045030	I know that this, this is my life's calling.
351045031	
351045032	
351045033	
351045034	
351045035	
351045036	
351045037	
351045038	
351045039	
351045040	The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.
351046000	Master! What ever is the matter?
351046001	
351046002	
351046003	
351046004	
351046005	
351046006	
351046007	
351046008	
351046009	
351046010	Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms!
351046011	
351046012	
351046013	
351046014	
351046015	
351046016	
351046017	
351046018	
351046019	
351046020	I must be the one to record them!
351046021	
351046022	
351046023	
351046024	
351046025	
351046026	
351046027	
351046028	
351046029	
351046030	What matters this issue of Radagon, really?
351046031	
351046032	
351046033	
351046034	
351046035	
351046036	
351046037	
351046038	
351046039	
351046040	The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!
351046041	
351046042	
351046043	
351046044	
351046045	
351046046	
351046047	
351046048	
351046049	
351046050	Why must these qualms come to you now?
351046051	
351046052	
351046053	
351046054	
351046055	
351046056	
351046057	
351046058	
351046059	
351046060	We were on the very cusp!
351047000	Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.
351047001	
351047002	
351047003	
351047004	
351047005	
351047006	
351047007	
351047008	
351047009	
351047010	I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.
351048000	Did you need something else?
351049000	Oh, was that you?
351049001	
351049002	
351049003	
351049004	
351049005	
351049006	
351049007	
351049008	
351049009	
351049010	Yes, the master is still ceased.
351049011	
351049012	
351049013	
351049014	
351049015	
351049016	
351049017	
351049018	
351049019	
351049020	And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times?
351050000	The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.
351050001	
351050002	
351050003	
351050004	
351050005	
351050006	
351050007	
351050008	
351050009	
351050010	While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.
351050011	
351050012	
351050013	
351050014	
351050015	
351050016	
351050017	
351050018	
351050019	
351050020	Until he simply ceased.
351050021	
351050022	
351050023	
351050024	
351050025	
351050026	
351050027	
351050028	
351050029	
351050030	Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.
351050031	
351050032	
351050033	
351050034	
351050035	
351050036	
351050037	
351050038	
351050039	
351050040	The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...
351050041	
351050042	
351050043	
351050044	
351050045	
351050046	
351050047	
351050048	
351050049	
351050050	The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...
351050051	
351050052	
351050053	
351050054	
351050055	
351050056	
351050057	
351050058	
351050059	
351050060	Who exactly was Radagon?
351050061	
351050062	
351050063	
351050064	
351050065	
351050066	
351050067	
351050068	
351050069	
351050070	The master is stumped.
351050071	
351050072	
351050073	
351050074	
351050075	
351050076	
351050077	
351050078	
351050079	
351050080	His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.
351050081	
351050082	
351050083	
351050084	
351050085	
351050086	
351050087	
351050088	
351050089	
351050090	Curse my mediocre mind.
351050091	
351050092	
351050093	
351050094	
351050095	
351050096	
351050097	
351050098	
351050099	
351050100	The master only has me, and here I fail him...
351051000	What on earth did you do to the master?
351051001	
351051002	
351051003	
351051004	
351051005	
351051006	
351051007	
351051008	
351051009	
351051010	Well, not that I'm complaining.
351051011	
351051012	
351051013	
351051014	
351051015	
351051016	
351051017	
351051018	
351051019	
351051020	Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.
351051021	
351051022	
351051023	
351051024	
351051025	
351051026	
351051027	
351051028	
351051029	
351051030	I haven't the words to thank you.
351051031	
351051032	
351051033	
351051034	
351051035	
351051036	
351051037	
351051038	
351051039	
351051040	So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.
351051041	
351051042	
351051043	
351051044	
351051045	
351051046	
351051047	
351051048	
351051049	
351051050	A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.
351052000	To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.
351052001	
351052002	
351052003	
351052004	
351052005	
351052006	
351052007	
351052008	
351052009	
351052010	Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.
351052011	
351052012	
351052013	
351052014	
351052015	
351052016	
351052017	
351052018	
351052019	
351052020	How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.
351052021	
351052022	
351052023	
351052024	
351052025	
351052026	
351052027	
351052028	
351052029	
351052030	Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.
351052031	
351052032	
351052033	
351052034	
351052035	
351052036	
351052037	
351052038	
351052039	
351052040	Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?
351052041	
351052042	
351052043	
351052044	
351052045	
351052046	
351052047	
351052048	
351052049	
351052050	...
351052051	
351052052	
351052053	
351052054	
351052055	
351052056	
351052057	
351052058	
351052059	
351052060	Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.
351052061	
351052062	
351052063	
351052064	
351052065	
351052066	
351052067	
351052068	
351052069	
351052070	In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not,
351052071	
351052072	
351052073	
351052074	
351052075	
351052076	
351052077	
351052078	
351052079	
351052080	I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.
351053000	Who exactly was Radagon?
351053001	
351053002	
351053003	
351053004	
351053005	
351053006	
351053007	
351053008	
351053009	
351053010	The master is stumped.
351053011	
351053012	
351053013	
351053014	
351053015	
351053016	
351053017	
351053018	
351053019	
351053020	His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.
351053021	
351053022	
351053023	
351053024	
351053025	
351053026	
351053027	
351053028	
351053029	
351053030	But oh, how important could it really be?
351053031	
351053032	
351053033	
351053034	
351053035	
351053036	
351053037	
351053038	
351053039	
351053040	The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!
351053041	
351053042	
351053043	
351053044	
351053045	
351053046	
351053047	
351053048	
351053049	
351053050	Why must these qualms come to you now?
351053051	
351053052	
351053053	
351053054	
351053055	
351053056	
351053057	
351053058	
351053059	
351053060	We were on the very cusp!
351060000	Ah, nice to see you.
351060001	
351060002	
351060003	
351060004	
351060005	
351060006	
351060007	
351060008	
351060009	
351060010	I can't believe you've come all this way.
351060011	
351060012	
351060013	
351060014	
351060015	
351060016	
351060017	
351060018	
351060019	
351060020	
351061000	Do you need...something else?
351062000	Ah, nice to see you.
351062001	
351062002	
351062003	
351062004	
351062005	
351062006	
351062007	
351062008	
351062009	
351062010	Do you need...something else?
351065000	I've…been gripped by a terrifying thought.
351065001	
351065002	
351065003	
351065004	
351065005	
351065006	
351065007	
351065008	
351065009	
351065010	The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...
351065011	
351065012	
351065013	
351065014	
351065015	
351065016	
351065017	
351065018	
351065019	
351065020	betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.
351065021	
351065022	
351065023	
351065024	
351065025	
351065026	
351065027	
351065028	
351065029	
351065030	A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.
351065031	
351065032	
351065033	
351065034	
351065035	
351065036	
351065037	
351065038	
351065039	
351065040	Oh, but how could this be?
351065041	
351065042	
351065043	
351065044	
351065045	
351065046	
351065047	
351065048	
351065049	
351065050	I dread to even entertain the possibility...
351065051	
351065052	
351065053	
351065054	
351065055	
351065056	
351065057	
351065058	
351065059	
351065060	but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master.
351065061	
351065062	
351065063	
351065064	
351065065	
351065066	
351065067	
351065068	
351065069	
351065070	Tell me, have I simply lost my head?
351065071	
351065072	
351065073	
351065074	
351065075	
351065076	
351065077	
351065078	
351065079	
351065080	Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order,
351065081	
351065082	
351065083	
351065084	
351065085	
351065086	
351065087	
351065088	
351065089	
351065090	why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?
351066000	Oh master, put my mind at ease.
351066001	
351066002	
351066003	
351066004	
351066005	
351066006	
351066007	
351066008	
351066009	
351066010	Dispel these fearsome thoughts.
351066011	
351066012	
351066013	
351066014	
351066015	
351066016	
351066017	
351066018	
351066019	
351066020	I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.
351066021	
351066022	
351066023	
351066024	
351066025	
351066026	
351066027	
351066028	
351066029	
351066030	<sobbing>
351067000	What...is this?
351067001	
351067002	
351067003	
351067004	
351067005	
351067006	
351067007	
351067008	
351067009	
351067010	It will make me forget, you say?
351067011	
351067012	
351067013	
351067014	
351067015	
351067016	
351067017	
351067018	
351067019	
351067020	So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...
351067021	
351067022	
351067023	
351067024	
351067025	
351067026	
351067027	
351067028	
351067029	
351067030	Ha...ha ha...
351067031	
351067032	
351067033	
351067034	
351067035	
351067036	
351067037	
351067038	
351067039	
351067040	Would that I could... Would that I could...
351067041	
351067042	
351067043	
351067044	
351067045	
351067046	
351067047	
351067048	
351067049	
351067050	 
351070000	Oh, it's you.
351070001	
351070002	
351070003	
351070004	
351070005	
351070006	
351070007	
351070008	
351070009	
351070010	I've finally come to understand.
351070011	
351070012	
351070013	
351070014	
351070015	
351070016	
351070017	
351070018	
351070019	
351070020	The master was nothing more than a madman.
351070021	
351070022	
351070023	
351070024	
351070025	
351070026	
351070027	
351070028	
351070029	
351070030	Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,
351070031	
351070032	
351070033	
351070034	
351070035	
351070036	
351070037	
351070038	
351070039	
351070040	seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!
351070041	
351070042	
351070043	
351070044	
351070045	
351070046	
351070047	
351070048	
351070049	
351070050	Could there be a more pitiable comedy?
351070051	
351070052	
351070053	
351070054	
351070055	
351070056	
351070057	
351070058	
351070059	
351070060	Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!
351070061	
351070062	
351070063	
351070064	
351070065	
351070066	
351070067	
351070068	
351070069	
351070070	Ha...ha ha ha...
351080000	Master...where did you go?
351080001	
351080002	
351080003	
351080004	
351080005	
351080006	
351080007	
351080008	
351080009	
351080010	I'm right here. Please, show me.
351080011	
351080012	
351080013	
351080014	
351080015	
351080016	
351080017	
351080018	
351080019	
351080020	Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus.
351080021	
351080022	
351080023	
351080024	
351080025	
351080026	
351080027	
351080028	
351080029	
351080030	Let me document the motions...
351080031	
351080032	
351080033	
351080034	
351080035	
351080036	
351080037	
351080038	
351080039	
351080040	Master...master...
351080041	
351080042	
351080043	
351080044	
351080045	
351080046	
351080047	
351080048	
351080049	
351080050	Where did you go?
351090000	This...is a volume of incantation.
351090001	
351090002	
351090003	
351090004	
351090005	
351090006	
351090007	
351090008	
351090009	
351090010	It's good to see your enthusiasm.
351090011	
351090012	
351090013	
351090014	
351090015	
351090016	
351090017	
351090018	
351090019	
351090020	Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands.
351091000	That...is a work of heresy.
351091001	
351091002	
351091003	
351091004	
351091005	
351091006	
351091007	
351091008	
351091009	
351091010	Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.
351091011	
351091012	
351091013	
351091014	
351091015	
351091016	
351091017	
351091018	
351091019	
351091020	My interests lie solely in the Golden Order.
351091021	
351091022	
351091023	
351091024	
351091025	
351091026	
351091027	
351091028	
351091029	
351091030	I cannot accept this.
351092000	That...is a work of heresy.
351092001	
351092002	
351092003	
351092004	
351092005	
351092006	
351092007	
351092008	
351092009	
351092010	Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.
351092011	
351092012	
351092013	
351092014	
351092015	
351092016	
351092017	
351092018	
351092019	
351092020	...
351092021	
351092022	
351092023	
351092024	
351092025	
351092026	
351092027	
351092028	
351092029	
351092030	Very well...I'll take it off your hands.
351092031	
351092032	
351092033	
351092034	
351092035	
351092036	
351092037	
351092038	
351092039	
351092040	I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith.
351092041	
351092042	
351092043	
351092044	
351092045	
351092046	
351092047	
351092048	
351092049	
351092050	Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master.

351801008	
351801009	
351801010	Cease that!
351802000	You've done it now.
351802001	
351802002	
351802003	
351802004

351802007	
351802008	
351802009	
351802010	Faith grants me strength, that I might endure.

351802020	O Golden Order, shine through me.
351803000	I pray...
351803001	
351803002	
351803003	
351803004	
351803005	
351803006	
351803007	
351803008	
351803009	
351803010	That the guidance of grace abandons you.
351804000	Please don't trouble us again.
351805000	O guidance...of grace...
351805001	
351805002

351805010	Why...can't I...
351806000	O, master...

351806004	
351806005	
351806006	
351806007	
351806008	
351806009	
351806010	To be ever...at your side...

351900018	
351900019	
351900020	 
700001000	A proper death means returning to the Erdtree.

700001007	
700001008	
700001009	
700001010	Have patience. Until the time comes...and the roots call to you.

700001018	
700001019	
700001020	...
700010000	The mausoleum prowls. Cradling the soulless demigod.

700010002	
700010003	
700010004	
700010005	
700010006	
700010007	
700010008	
700010009	
700010010	O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child.

700020000	O Sapling! Sweet sapling of glorious gold.
700020001

700020003	
700020004	
700020005	
700020006	
700020007	
700020008	
700020009	
700020010	Has your crystal teardrop ripened?

700020014	
700020015

700020018	
700020019	
700020020	...
700030000	Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting place is violated.
700030001	
700030002	
700030003	
700030004	
700030005	
700030006	
700030007	
700030008	
700030009	
700030010	To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death... Sickening.
700030011	
700030012	
700030013	
700030014	
700030015

700040000	The demi-humans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken...

700040014	
700040015	
700040016	
700040017	
700040018	
700040019	
700040020	The knight...bedeviled by blood.
700040021

700040023	
700040024	
700040025

700040028	
700040029	
700040030	...
700050000	Please, help me. I'm of noble blood.
700050001	
700050002	
700050003	
700050004	
700050005	
700050006	
700050007	
700050008	
700050009	
700050010	If those hideous mongrels eat me, I'll be forever marred...
700050011

700050014	
700050015

700050017	
700050018	
700050019	
700050020	Anything but that, please! Think of the disgrace!
700050021

700050024	
700050025	
700050026	
700050027	
700050028	
700050029	
700050030	...
700060000	All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...
700060001	
700060002	
700060003	
700060004	
700060005	
700060006	
700060007	
700060008	
700060009	
700060010	So, why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?
700060011	
700060012	
700060013	
700060014	
700060015

700070007	
700070008	
700070009	
700070010	Maiden, dear maiden, where are you?
700070011	
700070012	
700070013	
700070014	
700070015	
700070016	
700070017	
700070018	
700070019	
700070020	Please, take my grapes.
700080000	...
700080001	
700080002	
700080003	
700080004

700080006	
700080007	
700080008	
700080009	
700080010	Ohh, there it is, the tower!
700080011	
700080012	
700080013	
700080014	
700080015	
700080016	
700080017	
700080018	
700080019	
700080020	Finally, I can return. To our home, bathed in rays of gold!
701000020	...
701001000	This village is done for.
701001001	
701001002	
701001003	
701001004	
701001005	
701001006	
701001007	
701001008	
701001009	
701001010	Please, even if it's just you, old Albus, hide well and still your breath.
701010000	...
701010001	
701010002	
701010003	
701010004	
701010005	
701010006	
701010007	
701010008	
701010009	
701010010	Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all.
701010011	
701010012	
701010013	
701010014	
701010015	
701010016	
701010017	
701010018	
701010019	
701010020	Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.
701010021	
701010022	
701010023	
701010024	
701010025	
701010026	
701010027	
701010028	
701010029	
701010030	We beg of you, incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
701010031	
701010032	
701010033	
701010034	
701010035	
701010036	
701010037	
701010038	
701010039	
701010040	Ahh, may chaos take the world!

701020014	
701020015

701030007	
701030008

701030010	Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic.

701030012	
701030013	
701030014	
701030015	
701030016	
701030017	
701030018	
701030019	
701030020	Why shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone?
701040000	...
701040001	
701040002	
701040003	
701040004	
701040005	
701040006	
701040007	
701040008	
701040009	
701040010	Ahh, Iji, forgive me.

701040014	
701040015	
701040016	
701040017	
701040018	
701040019	
701040020	These royal grounds were placed in our trust,
701040021	
701040022	
701040023	
701040024	
701040025	
701040026	
701040027	
701040028	
701040029	
701040030	but we stood no chance.
701050000	...

701050006	
701050007	
701050008	
701050009	
701050010	O Celestial Globe, transmit to posterity. The wisdom of the moon and stars.
701050011	
701050012	
701050013	
701050014	
701050015	
701050016	
701050017	
701050018	
701050019	
701050020	And obscure, forever, the transgressions of the princess.
701060000	...

701060010	Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you.

701060015	
701060016	
701060017	
701060018	
701060019	
701060020	I pray for your house's swift revival.
701060021	
701060022	
701060023	
701060024	
701060025	
701060026	
701060027	
701060028	
701060029	
701060030	May the full moon shine upon Caria.
701070000	Come out, one and all, from the darkness underground.
701070001	
701070002	
701070003

701070006	
701070007	
701070008	
701070009	
701070010	And let us offer unto the maiden our eyes.
701070011	
701070012	
701070013	
701070014	
701070015

701070018	
701070019	
701070020	...
701080000	Ahh, the poor fellow...gone perfectly mad.
701080001	
701080002	
701080003	
701080004	
701080005	
701080006	
701080007	
701080008	
701080009	
701080010	Love...revenge...the frenzied flame melts it all away...

701090007	
701090008	
701090009	
701090010	It's there, somewhere.
701090011	
701090012	
701090013	
701090014	
701090015	
701090016	
701090017	
701090018	
701090019	
701090020	Another path, leading back to the foot of the Erdtree.

701090026	
701090027	
701090028	
701090029	
701090030	An ancient tunnel.

800008008	
800008009	
800008010	you should buy yourself a crafting kit.
800008011	
800008012	
800008013	
800008014	
800008015	
800008016	
800008017	
800008018	
800008019	
800008020	A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own.
800008021	
800008022	
800008023	
800008024	
800008025	
800008026	
800008027	
800008028	
800008029	
800008030	Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration.
800008031	
800008032	
800008033	
800008034	
800008035	
800008036	
800008037	
800008038	
800008039	
800008040	The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut.
800008041	
800008042	
800008043	
800008044	
800008045	
800008046	
800008047	
800008048	
800008049	
800008050	But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.
800009000	I'm glad you took my warning to heart.
800009001	
800009002	
800009003	
800009004	
800009005	
800009006	
800009007	
800009008	
800009009	
800009010	You've made an excellent choice.
800010000	There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands.
800010001	
800010002	
800010003	
800010004	
800010005	
800010006	
800010007	
800010008	
800010009	
800010010	If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you?
800010011	
800010012	
800010013	
800010014	
800010015	
800010016	
800010017	
800010018	
800010019	
800010020	My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold.
800010021	
800010022	
800010023	
800010024	
800010025	
800010026	
800010027	
800010028	
800010029	
800010030	Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.
800010031	
800010032	
800010033	
800010034	
800010035	
800010036	
800010037	
800010038	
800010039	
800010040	But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.
800010041	
800010042	
800010043	
800010044	
800010045	
800010046	
800010047	
800010048	
800010049	
800010050	I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts.
800010051	
800010052	
800010053	
800010054	
800010055	
800010056	
800010057	
800010058	
800010059	
800010060	Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.
800011000	I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you.
800011001	
800011002	
800011003	
800011004	
800011005	
800011006	
800011007	
800011008	
800011009	
800011010	 I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time.
800011011	
800011012	
800011013	
800011014	
800011015	
800011016	
800011017	
800011018	
800011019	
800011020	My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason...
800011021	
800011022	
800011023	
800011024	
800011025	
800011026	
800011027	
800011028	
800011029	
800011030	But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan.
800012000	Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but...
800012001	
800012002	
800012003	
800012004	
800012005	
800012006	
800012007	
800012008	
800012009	
800012010	See that no harm comes to my kin.
800012011	
800012012	
800012013	
800012014	
800012015	
800012016	
800012017	
800012018	
800012019	
800012020	We have a saying, we wanderers.
800012021	
800012022	
800012023	
800012024	
800012025	
800012026	
800012027	
800012028	
800012029	
800012030	Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing.
800012031	
800012032	
800012033	
800012034	
800012035	
800012036	
800012037	
800012038	
800012039	
800012040	But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy.
800012041	
800012042	
800012043	
800012044	
800012045	
800012046	
800012047	
800012048	
800012049	
800012050	That is our code, so to speak.
800012051	
800012052	
800012053	
800012054	
800012055	
800012056	
800012057	
800012058	
800012059	
800012060	Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.
800013000	Ah, by the way...
800013001	
800013002	
800013003	
800013004	
800013005	
800013006	
800013007	
800013008	
800013009	
800013010	Have you heard of the Great Caravan?
800014000	...I see, more's the pity.
800014001	
800014002	
800014003	
800014004	
800014005	
800014006	
800014007	
800014008	
800014009	
800014010	Well, even we had a place to call home, once.\n
800014011	
800014012	
800014013	
800014014	
800014015	
800014016	
800014017	
800014018	
800014019	
800014020	The Great Caravan, they called it… but it's been lost to us for ages.
800014021	
800014022	
800014023	
800014024	
800014025	
800014026	
800014027	
800014028	
800014029	
800014030	I've been searching for it as long as I can remember.
800014031	
800014032	
800014033	
800014034	
800014035	
800014036	
800014037	
800014038	
800014039	
800014040	And with a name like that,
800014041	
800014042	
800014043	
800014044	
800014045	
800014046	
800014047	
800014048	
800014049	
800014050	You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh.
800015000	The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...
800015001	
800015002	
800015003	
800015004	
800015005	
800015006	
800015007	
800015008	
800015009	
800015010	I suppose he must still be skulking about...
800015011	
800015012	
800015013	
800015014	
800015015	
800015016	
800015017	
800015018	
800015019	
800015020	Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself?
800015021	
800015022	
800015023	
800015024	
800015025	
800015026	
800015027	
800015028	
800015029	
800015030	Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source.
800015031	
800015032	
800015033	
800015034	
800015035	
800015036	
800015037	
800015038	
800015039	
800015040	Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear.
800015041	
800015042	
800015043	
800015044	
800015045	
800015046	
800015047	
800015048	
800015049	
800015050	I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off.
800016000	Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet.
800016001	
800016002	
800016003	
800016004	
800016005	
800016006	
800016007	
800016008	
800016009	
800016010	If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source.
800017000	Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you?
800017001	
800017002	
800017003	
800017004	
800017005	
800017006	
800017007	
800017008	
800017009	
800017010	Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction.
800017011	
800017012	
800017013	
800017014	
800017015	
800017016	
800017017	
800017018	
800017019	
800017020	He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg.
800017021	
800017022	
800017023	
800017024	
800017025	
800017026	
800017027	
800017028	
800017029	
800017030	I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.
800030000	Ah, good to see you.
800030001	
800030002	
800030003	
800030004	
800030005	
800030006	
800030007	
800030008	
800030009	
800030010	I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.
800030011	
800030012	
800030013	
800030014	
800030015	
800030016	
800030017	
800030018	
800030019	
800030020	Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.
800030021	
800030022	
800030023	
800030024	
800030025	
800030026	
800030027	
800030028	
800030029	
800030030	A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything?
800031000	We meet again, I see.
800031001	
800031002	
800031003	
800031004	
800031005	
800031006	
800031007	
800031008	
800031009	
800031010	It's me, Kalé.
800031011	
800031012	
800031013	
800031014	
800031015	
800031016	
800031017	
800031018	
800031019	
800031020	Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.
800031021	
800031022	
800031023	
800031024	
800031025	
800031026	
800031027	
800031028	
800031029	
800031030	Right then. Care to purchase anything?
800032000	Have you seen a crow around here by any chance?
800032001	
800032002	
800032003	
800032004	
800032005	
800032006	
800032007	
800032008	
800032009	
800032010	You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw?
800032011	
800032012	
800032013	
800032014	
800032015	
800032016	
800032017	
800032018	
800032019	
800032020	Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question.
800032021	
800032022	
800032023	
800032024	
800032025	
800032026	
800032027	
800032028	
800032029	
800032030	I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course.
800033000	My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.
800033001	
800033002	
800033003	
800033004	
800033005	
800033006	
800033007	
800033008	
800033009	
800033010	And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised.
800034000	So, about the letter you brought me...
800034001	
800034002	
800034003	
800034004	
800034005	
800034006	
800034007	
800034008	
800034009	
800034010	It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.
800034011	
800034012	
800034013	
800034014	
800034015	
800034016	
800034017	
800034018	
800034019	
800034020	And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.
800034021	
800034022	
800034023	
800034024	
800034025	
800034026	
800034027	
800034028	
800034029	
800034030	This could be my chance to get close to it.
800034031	
800034032	
800034033	
800034034	
800034035	
800034036	
800034037	
800034038	
800034039	
800034040	Thanks to you.
800035000	Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.
800035001	
800035002	
800035003	
800035004	
800035005	
800035006	
800035007	
800035008	
800035009	
800035010	Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.
800035011	
800035012	
800035013	
800035014	
800035015	
800035016	
800035017	
800035018	
800035019	
800035020	With any luck, I'll see you there, eh.
800036000	I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...
800036001	
800036002	
800036003	
800036004	
800036005	
800036006	
800036007	
800036008	
800036009	
800036010	And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...
800036011	
800036012	
800036013	
800036014	
800036015	
800036016	
800036017	
800036018	
800036019	
800036020	But there's something I need to know.
800036021	
800036022	
800036023	
800036024	
800036025	
800036026	
800036027	
800036028	
800036029	
800036030	My roots.
800036031	
800036032	
800036033	
800036034	
800036035	
800036036	
800036037	
800036038	
800036039	
800036040	I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed.
800050000	Ah, good to see you.
800050001	
800050002	
800050003	
800050004	
800050005	
800050006	
800050007	
800050008	
800050009	
800050010	I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.
800050011	
800050012	
800050013	
800050014	
800050015	
800050016	
800050017	
800050018	
800050019	
800050020	The shop is all set up.
800050021	
800050022	
800050023	
800050024	
800050025	
800050026	
800050027	
800050028	
800050029	
800050030	A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything?
800051000	Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...
800051001	
800051002	
800051003	
800051004	
800051005	
800051006	
800051007	
800051008	
800051009	
800051010	I think it's pointing underneath the capital.
800051011	
800051012	
800051013	
800051014	
800051015	
800051016	
800051017	
800051018	
800051019	
800051020	I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.
800051021	
800051022	
800051023	
800051024	
800051025	
800051026	
800051027	
800051028	
800051029	
800051030	But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.
800051031	
800051032	
800051033	
800051034	
800051035	
800051036	
800051037	
800051038	
800051039	
800051040	Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.
800051041	
800051042	
800051043	
800051044	
800051045	
800051046	
800051047	
800051048	
800051049	
800051050	I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it.
800052000	Where...did you find this letter?
800053000	I can't imagine how it ended up there...
800053001	
800053002	
800053003	
800053004	
800053005	
800053006	
800053007	
800053008	
800053009	
800053010	But the well might just lead under the capital.
800053011	
800053012	
800053013	
800053014	
800053015	
800053016	
800053017	
800053018	
800053019	
800053020	To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.
800053021	
800053022	
800053023	
800053024	
800053025	
800053026	
800053027	
800053028	
800053029	
800053030	Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...
800053031	
800053032	
800053033	
800053034	
800053035	
800053036	
800053037	
800053038	
800053039	
800053040	But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.
800053041	
800053042	
800053043	
800053044	
800053045	
800053046	
800053047	
800053048	
800053049	
800053050	Once again, I find myself in your debt.
800053051	
800053052	
800053053	
800053054	
800053055	
800053056	
800053057	
800053058	
800053059	
800053060	Take this, as a token of my appreciation.
800053061	
800053062	
800053063	
800053064	
800053065	
800053066	
800053067	
800053068	
800053069	
800053070	It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.
800053071	
800053072	
800053073	
800053074	
800053075	
800053076	
800053077	
800053078	
800053079	
800053080	I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.
800053081	
800053082	
800053083	
800053084	
800053085	
800053086	
800053087	
800053088	
800053089	
800053090	Who knows what wonders there might be to trade?
800054000	Ah, you, is it...
800054001	
800054002	
800054003	
800054004	
800054005	
800054006	
800054007	
800054008	
800054009	
800054010	Did you see? What they did to my ancestors?
800054011	
800054012	
800054013	
800054014	
800054015	
800054016	
800054017	
800054018	
800054019	
800054020	The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves.
800054021	
800054022	
800054023	
800054024	
800054025	
800054026	
800054027	
800054028	
800054029	
800054030	Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.
800054031	
800054032	
800054033	
800054034	
800054035	
800054036	
800054037	
800054038	
800054039	
800054040	They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?
800054041	
800054042	
800054043	
800054044	
800054045	
800054046	
800054047	
800054048	
800054049	
800054050	Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! 
800054051	
800054052	
800054053	
800054054	
800054055	
800054056	
800054057	
800054058	
800054059	
800054060	The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.
800054061	
800054062	
800054063	
800054064	
800054065	
800054066	
800054067	
800054068	
800054069	
800054070	But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...
800054071	
800054072	
800054073	
800054074	
800054075	
800054076	
800054077	
800054078	
800054079	
800054080	I'll never forgive any of you.
800055000	I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.
800055001	
800055002	
800055003	
800055004	
800055005	
800055006	
800055007	
800055008	
800055009	
800055010	And...I think it's time we parted ways.
800055011	
800055012	
800055013	
800055014	
800055015	
800055016	
800055017	
800055018	
800055019	
800055020	Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord.
800055021	
800055022	
800055023	
800055024	
800055025	
800055026	
800055027	
800055028	
800055029	
800055030	I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more.
800056000	I should apologise to you.
800056001	
800056002	
800056003	
800056004	
800056005	
800056006	
800056007	
800056008	
800056009	
800056010	It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess.
800056011	
800056012	
800056013	
800056014	
800056015	
800056016	
800056017	
800056018	
800056019	
800056020	I'm sorry.
800057000	I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.
800057001	
800057002	
800057003	
800057004	
800057005	
800057006	
800057007	
800057008	
800057009	
800057010	I think it's time we parted ways.
800058000	Wait, what's that?
800058001	
800058002	
800058003	
800058004	
800058005	
800058006	
800058007	
800058008	
800058009	
800058010	That burn...
800058011	
800058012	
800058013	
800058014	
800058015	
800058016	
800058017	
800058018	
800058019	
800058020	Your eyes...
800058021	
800058022	
800058023	
800058024	
800058025	
800058026	
800058027	
800058028	
800058029	
800058030	You've inherited the flame of frenzy!
800058031	
800058032	
800058033	
800058034	
800058035	
800058036	
800058037	
800058038	
800058039	
800058040	Oh, that's it... That's what I need...
800058041	
800058042	
800058043	
800058044	
800058045	
800058046	
800058047	
800058048	
800058049	
800058050	To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
800058051	
800058052	
800058053	
800058054	
800058055	
800058056	
800058057	
800058058	
800058059	
800058060	The yellow flame of chaos...
800059000	Oh, that's it... That's what I need...
800059001	
800059002	
800059003	
800059004	
800059005	
800059006	
800059007	
800059008	
800059009	
800059010	To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
800059011	
800059012	
800059013	
800059014	
800059015	
800059016	
800059017	
800059018	
800059019	
800059020	The yellow flame of chaos...
800070000	O Three Fingers, throw wide the door.
800070001	
800070002	
800070003	
800070004	
800070005	
800070006	
800070007	
800070008	
800070009	
800070010	Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos.
800070011	
800070012	
800070013	
800070014	
800070015	
800070016	
800070017	
800070018	
800070019	
800070020	A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
800070021	
800070022	
800070023	
800070024	
800070025	
800070026	
800070027	
800070028	
800070029	
800070030	May chaos take the world.
800070031	
800070032	
800070033	
800070034	
800070035	
800070036	
800070037	
800070038	
800070039	
800070040	May chaos take the world.
800071000	The frenzied flame...burned me...
800071001	
800071002	
800071003	
800071004	
800071005	
800071006	
800071007	
800071008	
800071009	
800071010	I was not... a suitable home.
800071011	
800071012	
800071013	
800071014	
800071015	
800071016	
800071017	
800071018	
800071019	
800071020	Unknown warrior...
800071021	
800071022	
800071023	
800071024	
800071025	
800071026	
800071027	
800071028	
800071029	
800071030	You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss...
800071031	
800071032	
800071033	
800071034	
800071035	
800071036	
800071037	
800071038	
800071039	
800071040	Tell the one... Who will become Lord...
800071041	
800071042	
800071043	
800071044	
800071045	
800071046	
800071047	
800071048	
800071049	
800071050	Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door.
800071051	
800071052	
800071053	
800071054	
800071055	
800071056	
800071057	
800071058	
800071059	
800071060	Divest yourself of everything...

800071062	
800071063	
800071064	
800071065	
800071066	
800071067	
800071068	
800071069	
800071070	And pray to the Lord...

800071073	
800071074	
800071075	
800071076	
800071077	
800071078	
800071079	
800071080	To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.

800071090	May chaos...take the world.

800071098	
800071099	
800071100	...
800072000	The frenzied flame...burned me...

800072002	
800072003	
800072004	
800072005	
800072006	
800072007

800072010	I was not... a suitable home.

800100037	
800100038	
800100039	
800100040	That's a very kind gesture, and I accept.

800802010	Then it's time you learnt a lesson.

800802018	
800802019	
800802020	Our people will not stand for your barbarism!
800803000	Is that all you were, mate?
800804000	Is this...how it ends?

800811007	
800811008	
800811009	
800811010	Another would-be oppressor to my people.
800812000	I see. I see how it is! You were one of them all along!

800812010	Trying to trample us underfoot, you grace-given bastard?
800813000	I'll never forgive your kind...
800814000	Your kind...will all be razed clean.

801201009	
801201010	Is there anything wrong?
801202000	Ooh!
801202001

801202013	
801202014	
801202015	
801202016	
801202017	
801202018	
801202019	
801202020	I-I didn't realise you came back.
801203000	I-I must apologise.
801203001

801203007	
801203008	
801203009	
801203010	I'm afraid I've very little to offer.
801204000	Oh, nothing that suits your tastes, then?

801300007	
801300008	
801300009	
801300010	It's been an age since I've seen a customer.

801300016	
801300017	
801300018	
801300019	
801300020	How can I help, here at the end of the earth?
801301000	Anything else for you?
801302000	Back already?
801302001	
801302002	
801302003	
801302004	
801302005	
801302006	
801302007	
801302008	
801302009	
801302010	Unusual fellow, aren't we.
801302011	
801302012	
801302013	
801302014	
801302015	
801302016	
801302017	
801302018	
801302019	
801302020	Did this aged merchant have something that caught your eye?
801303000	Have a safe journey.
801350000	Is someone there?
801350001	
801350002	
801350003	
801350004	
801350005	
801350006	
801350007	
801350008	
801350009	
801350010	A customer?
801350011	
801350012	
801350013	
801350014	
801350015	
801350016	
801350017	
801350018	
801350019	
801350020	Well, how long has it been.
801351000	Something else?
801352000	Well, there you are again.
801352001	
801352002	
801352003	
801352004	
801352005	
801352006	
801352007	
801352008	
801352009	
801352010	Divorce from one's trade does not come easily.
801800000	Agh! 
801800001	
801800002	
801800003
